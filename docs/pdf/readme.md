# CIITR-Related Papers and Articles (Chronological Register)

This page provides a chronological register of papers, theory notes, and articles that are directly or indirectly related to the development and application of CIITR.

The documents listed here reflect the historical evolution of ideas associated with CIITR.  
Inclusion in this register does **not** imply kernel-level conformity unless explicitly stated.  
Each entry is described according to its structural role and relevance *at the time of writing*.

The list is ordered chronologically, with the most recent documents at the top and the earliest works at the bottom.

| File | Theory note / paper / article synopsis | Description / argument why CIITR relevant |
|------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [2025.10.22 – The reflexive limit of artificial intelligence.pdf](2025.10.22%20-%20The%20reflexive%20limit%20of%20artificial%20intelligence.pdf) | Early conceptual essay on reflexivity, temporal structure, and limits of inference in artificial systems | Articulates the integration–reach distinction and the snapshot limitation problem contemporaneously with early CIITR development, prior to kernel formalization. Serves as a conceptual precursor to later CIITR principles concerning non-compensation, temporal invariance, and the separation between internal integration and externally coupled rhythmic re-entry. |

### Notes on interpretation

- Entries classified as *early*, *exploratory*, or *conceptual* should be read as part of the formative phase of CIITR, not as applications of a finalized kernel.
- Later theory notes and papers may explicitly reference the CIITR Kernel or Core Specification and will be described accordingly.
- No document listed here is retroactively modified to satisfy later formal criteria.
