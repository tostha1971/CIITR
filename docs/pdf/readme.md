|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2025-11-28 | [Long Contexts and Disjoint Retrieval Generation Optimization.pdf](2025.11.28%20-%20Long%20Contexts%20and%20Disjoint%20%20Retrieval%20Generation%20Optimization.pdf) | Structural and thermodynamic analysis of long-context architectures under CIITR | Provides a CIITR-based analysis of long-context scaling, demonstrating that expanded context windows amplify Φᵢ through retrieval while leaving rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) fixed at zero. Formalises the retrieval–generation bifurcation as a disjoint optimisation regime, derives the TPS–CPJ inversion, and situates long-context systems on the CIITR–Nash manifold, showing why increased context length yields syntactic reach without epistemic integration, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-25 | [A CIITR Defence Note.pdf](2025.11.25%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Defence%20Note.pdf) | Methodological defence note clarifying CIITR’s epistemic status | Provides a formal defence of CIITR as a boundary and invariance framework rather than an empirical hypothesis, addressing category errors in demands for benchmarks or ablation studies. Positions CIITR alongside structural limit arguments in physics, logic, and computation, clarifying why certain architectural claims require formal proof rather than experimental validation, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-25 | [Backpropagation, Syntactic Closure, and the CIITR Boundary.pdf](2025.11.25%20-%20Backpropagation,%20Syntactic%20Closure,%20and%20the%20CIITR%20Boundary.pdf) | Boundary-theoretic analysis of backpropagation as a comprehension constraint | Analyzes backpropagation through CIITR, showing that gradient-based optimization enforces syntactic closure that amplifies Φᵢ while structurally suppressing rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ). Demonstrates why backpropagation yields stable, coherent Type-B systems incapable of sustained understanding, positioning CIITR as a boundary framework distinguishing learnability from comprehension prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-23 | [Beyond Integration, Broadcast, Representation, and Recurrence.pdf](2025.11.23%20-%20Beyond%20Integration,%20Broadcast,%20Representation,%20and%20Recurrence.pdf) | Boundary-theoretic critique of dominant cognitive and AI paradigms | Examines integration, global broadcast, representational, and recurrent frameworks through CIITR, showing that each captures aspects of syntactic or informational structure while remaining insufficient for temporally sustained understanding. Positions CIITR as an orthogonal boundary framework explaining why Φᵢ-like integration without rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) yields persistent illusions of comprehension across cognitive theories, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-21 | [Algorithmic Syntax, Rhythmic Recursion, and the Limits of Understanding.pdf](2025.11.21%20-%20Algorithmic%20Syntax,%20Rhythmic%20Recursion,%20and%20the%20Limits%20of%20Understanding.pdf) | Theoretical synthesis generalising Penrose’s non-computability argument through CIITR | Reinterprets Roger Penrose’s critique of algorithmic cognition through the CIITR framework, formalising Gödel incompleteness as a special case of the Φᵢ/Rᵍ architectural boundary. Demonstrates that understanding collapses categorically when rhythmic recursion (Rᵍ) is absent, independent of syntactic integration or physical substrate, positioning CIITR as a general, substrate-agnostic theory of epistemic architecture prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-19 | [Googles AlphaEvolve and the Illusion of Mathematical Discovery.pdf](2025.11.19%20-%20Googles%20AlphaEvolve%20and%20the%20Illusion%20of%20Mathematical%20Discovery.pdf) | CIITR analysis of evolutionary mathematical discovery claims | Analyzes Google’s AlphaEvolve mathematics results through CIITR, arguing that evolutionary proof generation amplifies Φᵢ without achieving rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ), yielding synthetic novelty absent structural mathematical comprehension. Positions CIITR as a boundary framework distinguishing formal correctness and search efficiency from genuine mathematical understanding, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-13 | [Googles Nested Learning and the Illusion of Temporal Comprehension.pdf](2025.11.13%20-%20Googles%20Nested%20Learning%20and%20the%20Illusion%20of%20Temporal%20Comprehension.pdf) | Structural–thermodynamic CIITR analysis of nested and continual learning systems | Analyzes Google’s Nested Learning and HOPE architectures through CIITR, showing that hierarchical optimization amplifies Φᵢ while leaving rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) near zero. Demonstrates why temporal layering produces the illusion of continuity without phase-coherent comprehension, introduces proto-Rᵍ in nested loops, and explains CPJ decay in continual learning prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-08 | [Meta’s SPICE and the Illusion of Self-Improvement.pdf](2025.11.08%20-%20Meta%E2%80%99s%20SPICE%20and%20the%20Illusion%20of%20Self-Improvement.pdf) | Structural-thermodynamic CIITR analysis of adversarial self-play | Analyzes Meta’s SPICE self-play architecture through CIITR, showing Φᵢ growth with Rᵍ ≈ 0 yields performance without retained comprehension. Identifies an embryonic (proto) Rᵍ via shared-weight oscillation, explains CPJ decay under external verification, and outlines architectural pathways to convert proto-rhythm into genuine rhythmic reintegration, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-07 | [Beyond Scale - A CIITR Analysis of Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI and the 57 Billion Paradigm Error.pdf](2025.11.07%20-%20Beyond%20Scale%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Analysis%20of%20Small%20Language%20Models%20are%20the%20Future%20of%20Agentic%20AI%20and%20the%2057%20Billion%20Paradigm%20Error.pdf) | Industrial-scale CIITR analysis of SLM vs LLM paradigms | Reinterprets NVIDIA Research’s SLM findings through CIITR, arguing that the “$57 billion” scaling paradigm error reflects Φᵢ growth outpacing rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ), leading to collapsing comprehension yield. Positions CIITR as a structural and thermodynamic explanatory framework for why smaller, rhythmically coupled agentic systems outperform monolithic scale prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-06 | [Beyond the Reasoning Cliff.pdf](2025.11.06%20-%20Beyond%20the%20Reasoning%20Cliff.pdf) | CIITR reinterpretation of empirical reasoning depth collapse in LRMs | Reanalyzes the empirically observed “reasoning cliff” in large reasoning models as a collapse of rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) rather than computational saturation.

Serves as a contemporaneous probe of CIITR as a shared introspective language, preceding formal kernel closure, instrumentation rules, and negative-evidence constraints. |
| 2025-10-22 | [The reflexive limit of artificial intelligence.pdf](2025.10.22%20-%20The%20reflexive%20limit%20of%20artificial%20intelligence.pdf) | Early conceptual essay on reflexivity, temporal structure, and limits of inference in artificial systems | Articulates the integration–reach distinction and the snapshot limitation problem contemporaneously with early CIITR development, prior to kernel formalization.

### Notes on interpretation

- Entries classified as *early*, *exploratory*, or *conceptual* should be read as part of the formative phase of CIITR, not as applications of a finalized kernel.
- Later theory notes and papers may explicitly reference the CIITR Kernel or Core Specification and will be described accordingly.
- No document listed here is retroactively modified to satisfy later formal criteria.
