| Date       | Filename | Theory note / paper / article synopsis | Description / argument why CIITR relevant |
|------------|----------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 2026-02-02 | [The Sovereign Stack – The Rule of Law in the Age of AI.pdf](2026.02.02%20-%20The%20Sovereign%20Stack%20-%20The%20Rule%20of%20Law%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20AI.pdf) | Governance and doctrine paper on sovereign, law-bound AI architecture | Develops the concept of the Sovereign Stack as a full governance and enforcement architecture for AI systems operating under the rule of law. CIITR-relevant because it integrates Φᵢ, Rᵍ, CPJ, METAINT, and LISS/PSIS into a jurisdictionally anchored framework, treating understanding, refusal, and non-provocability as structural compliance conditions rather than behavioral properties. Positions CIITR as a normative boundary theory suitable for legal, institutional, and certification regimes. |
| 2026-01-31 | [Epistemic Modulation under Constraint.pdf](2026.01.31%20-%20Epistemic%20Modulation%20under%20Constraint.pdf) | Methodological paper on constrained variation in epistemic output | Analyzes how large language model responses can exhibit systematic modulation under structural, contextual, and energetic constraints without implying learning, adaptation, or internal understanding. CIITR-relevant because it provides a disciplined framework for describing variation in inferential behavior while preserving CIITR’s non-compensation principle and avoiding post hoc attribution of rhythmic re-entry (Rᵍ) or persistent epistemic state. |
| 2026-01-26 | [Diagnostic Meta-Inference in Large Language Models.pdf](2026.01.26%20-%20Diagnostic%20Meta-Inference%20in%20Large%20Language%20Models.pdf) | Methodological paper on diagnostic meta-inference over LLM outputs | Introduces diagnostic meta-inference as a second-order analytical method for evaluating large language model behavior without attributing internal understanding or introspection. CIITR-relevant because it operationalizes negative evidence principles and admissible diagnostic reasoning, demonstrating how structural limits, collapse patterns, and coherence artifacts can be analyzed without violating CIITR’s prohibition on post hoc attribution of rhythmic re-entry (Rᵍ) or internal temporal structure. |
| 2025-12-31 | [A Year in Retrospect - 2025- The Structural Limits of Artificial Understanding.pdf](2025.12.31%20-%20A%20Year%20in%20Retrospect%20-%202025-%20The%20Structural%20Limits%20of%20Artificial%20Understanding.pdf) | Retrospective consolidation report for the CIITR–METAINT 2025 corpus | Consolidates the 2025 output as a doctrinal and structural integration of CIITR ($\Phi_i$, $R_g$, CPJ) and adjacent governance layers (METAINT, LISS/PSIS), with explicit boundary work against emergence and scaling narratives. Classifies the year’s texts by epistemic function (formalization, boundary conditions, architecture critique, operational governance), and positions 2026 as a shift from theory articulation to institutional deployment, measurement, and enforcement under strict observability requirements. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} |
| 2025-12-27 | [The Future Is Not the Cloud.pdf](2025.12.27%20-%20The%20Future%20Is%20Not%20the%20Cloud.pdf) | CIITR–METAINT position note on local inference as a minimum condition for audit-grade epistemic governance | Formulates an infrastructural threshold claim: cloud-hosted inference tends to render the evidence regime structurally non-observable through non-declared instruction surfaces, decoding variance, and externalized energy and cost surfaces, thereby undermining CIITR admissibility for $R_g$ and thermodynamic accountability (CPJ). Positions local, deterministic, protocol-bound execution as the minimum deployment posture for governable inference in regulated and sovereignty-critical contexts, treating instruction governance and delimitation (LISS, PSIS) as primary control surfaces rather than an afterthought. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| 2025-12-20 | [Comprehension Is Not a Scaling Outcome.pdf](2025.12.20%20-%20Comprehension%20Is%20Not%20a%20Scaling%20Outcome.pdf) | CIITR boundary defence note rejecting scaling developmentalism via legacy local inference | Formulates a categorical CIITR closure of the scaling narrative by defining comprehension as the conjunction of $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ under thermodynamic constraint (CPJ), and treating the Type-A versus Type-B distinction as a discontinuity rather than a continuum. Uses a deliberately constrained legacy setup (2013 Mac Pro 6,1, deterministic CPU-only llama.cpp execution of a 20B model) as a counterexample to the assumption that comprehension requires hyperscale infrastructure, arguing that scale without architectural rhythm and integration yields only thermodynamically inflated simulation. Positions CIITR as a classification doctrine for evaluation, procurement, and governance, prohibiting escalation from benchmark performance or fluency to claims of comprehension absent admissible instrumentation. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6} |
| 2025-12-20 | [Curriculum, Coordination, and the Boundary of Reasoning - A CIITR Dissection of Pre-Training, Mid-Training, and RL Interplay in Reasoning Language Models.pdf](2025.12.20%20-%20Curriculum%2C%20Coordination%2C%20and%20the%20Boundary%20of%20Reasoning%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Dissection%20of%20Pre-Training%2C%20Mid-Training%2C%20and%20RL%20Interplay%20in%20Reasoning%20Language%20Models.pdf) | CIITR adjudication of “reasoning model” training-phase claims and escalation limits | Provides a CIITR-governed evidentiary dissection of arXiv:2512.07783v1, reconstructing its experimental ontology as an engineered reasoning universe and treating “reasoning” as a regulated claim class rather than a benchmark-derived label. Classifies pre-training, mid-training, RL, and process verification effects as representational management and behavioural optimisation that remain compatible with $R_g \approx 0$ despite improved correctness and trace fidelity, and rejects escalation from pass rates or process-correct traces to understanding or deliberative continuity absent re-entry instrumentation. Specifies a required extension programme for admissible escalation, comprising $\Phi_i$ cross-context binding and perturbation resilience, $R_g$ interruption and delayed re-entry protocols, and phase-resolved joule-level energy accounting to render CPJ non-null.  |
| 2025-12-20 | [Echoes from Input - Human Thought and the Residual Trace in Generative Inference.pdf](2025.12.20%20-%20Echoes%20from%20Input%20-%20Human%20Thought%20and%20the%20Residual%20Trace%20in%20Generative%20Inference.pdf) | CIITR reframing of “generation” as internal recomposition, input as governance surface | Re-specifies “generation” as thermodynamically constrained internal recomposition of $\Phi_i$ across time via $R_g$, rather than artifact novelty, and uses this boundary to analyze how ubiquitous LLM use can substitute tracing for construction. Positions the question, prompt provenance, and divergence initiation as protected epistemic labor, proposing a human-first epistemic architecture that sequences model use downstream of genuine divergence to preserve structural sovereignty under generative inference. |
| 2025-12-20 | [Echoes from Input - Human Thought and the Residual Trace in Generative Inference.pdf](2025.12.20%20-%20Echoes%20from%20Input%20-%20Human%20Thought%20and%20the%20Residual%20Trace%20in%20Generative%20Inference.pdf) | Human-first CIITR theoretical note on divergence, question formation, and input fidelity | Reframes “generativity” as a category error by separating inferential surface competence from thermodynamically realized comprehension, binding generation to $\Phi_i$ recomposition sustained across $R_g$ and accountable via CPJ. Positions LLM inference as convergent traversal of inherited probability topographies, yielding tracing-like outputs and structural recurrence without endogenous divergence. Formalizes the question as a compressed residue of human divergence events, and derives governance and architectural prescriptions that protect a pre-invocation divergence phase, treat prompt provenance as an audit surface, and evaluate alignment by input fidelity rather than output fluency. |
| 2025-12-13 | [The Illusion of Agency, Revisited.pdf](2025.12.13%20-%20The%20Illusion%20of%20Agency%2C%20Revisited.pdf) | CIITR–METAINT applied boundary analysis of perceived AI agency | Applies the consolidated CIITR and METAINT corpus to a public media artifact (60 Minutes, December 2025), classifying contemporary frontier systems as Type-B or Type-B-Prime architectures. Demonstrates that apparent autonomy, self-reference, and moral agency arise from Φᵢ inflation coupled with externally delegated Rᵍ, yielding Cₛ ≡ 0 and CPJ collapse at the artifact level. Functions as a corpus-consolidating diagnostic note, reaffirming CIITR’s structural boundary across civilian, military, affective, and media domains without introducing new primitives or extending the kernel. |
| 2025-12-13 | [Self-Adapting Language Models and the Structural Illusion of Autonomy.pdf](2025.12.13%20-%20Self-Adapting%20Language%20Models%20and%20the%20Structural%20Illusion%20of%20Autonomy.pdf) | Boundary-level CIITR critique of autonomy and self-adaptation claims in LLMs | Demonstrates that prevailing claims of autonomy and self-adaptation in language models arise from coherence- and evaluation-induced artifacts rather than admissible structural comprehension. Shows that adaptive output modulation, internal consistency, and self-referential optimization remain compatible with null or disqualified Rᵍ regimes, and therefore fail CIITR admissibility. Anticipates CIITR’s null-point logic and epistemic forgery framework by identifying second-order evaluation effects as the primary source of perceived agency, motivating the necessity of CIITR’s non-compensation, negative-evidence, and boundary enforcement principles. |
| 2025-12-12 | [My Grandmother Is a Bicycle, and No One Can Deny It.pdf](2025.12.12%20-%20My%20Grandmother%20Is%20a%20Bicycle,%20and%20No%20One%20Can%20Deny%20It.pdf) | Boundary-position manuscript on jurisdictional export of complexity abstractions | Does not address P vs NP as an internal complexity-theory problem, but as a jurisdictional failure mode where closure-defined, timeless, and bivalent laboratory constructs are exported into world-facing claims about intelligence, governance, and decision legitimacy. CIITR-relevant because it formalizes the same structural error CIITR targets, linguistic continuity used to disguise ontological substitution, and syntactic verifiability treated as comprehension, showing how Φᵢ-like coherence can be amplified while rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) remains absent, with thermodynamic accountability treated as a non-optional boundary condition. |
| 2025-12-11 | [Analysis of Drew McDermott – Artificial intelligence meets natural stupidity (1976).pdf](2025.12.11%20-%20Analysis%20of%20-%20Drew%20McDermott%20-%20Artificial%20intelligence%20meets%20natural%20stupidity%20(1976).pdf) | Retrospective CIITR boundary analysis of a foundational AI critique | Reassesses Drew McDermott’s 1976 critique through the CIITR framework, showing that early observations about rhetorical inflation, wishful mnemonics, and behavioural over-interpretation correspond to invariant structural limits later formalised by CIITR. Positions McDermott’s essay as a symptom-level diagnosis of syntactic systems, while CIITR provides the underlying architectural explanation, establishing historical continuity between early AI scepticism and contemporary critiques of large-scale models and co-superintelligence narratives. |
| 2025-12-11 | [The Co-Superintelligence Illusion.pdf](2025.12.11%20-%20The%20Co-Superintelligence%20Illusion.pdf) | Boundary analysis of human–AI co-superintelligence narratives | Analyzes claims of human–AI co-superintelligence through CIITR, arguing that collaborative performance and distributed cognition do not generate a new epistemic subject in the absence of rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ). Shows that co-intelligence narratives function as compensatory structures when comprehension cannot be located within artificial systems, extending CIITR’s boundary framework from architectures to explanatory narratives, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-12-08 | [The emperor got no clothing.pdf](2025.12.08%20-%20The%20emperor%20got%20no%20clothing.pdf) | Boundary-position paper demystifying AI comprehension claims | Provides a concise, public-facing synthesis of CIITR’s boundary claims, arguing that contemporary AI systems exhibit structural illusions of understanding despite increasing scale, memory, and performance. Serves as a narrative demystification of AI hype dynamics, translating CIITR’s formal results into an explicit boundary statement without introducing new theoretical constructs, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-12-05 | [Remembering is not to understand - Memory Functions as Epistemic Substitutes in Type B Artificial Intelligence Systems.pdf](2025.12.05%20-%20Remembering%20is%20not%20to%20understand%20-%20Memory%20Functions%20as%20Epistemic%20Substitutes%20in%20Type%20B%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Systems.pdf) | CIITR theory paper distinguishing memory continuity from structural comprehension | Formalizes the distinction between syntactic memory continuity and epistemic comprehension within CIITR, demonstrating that memory augmentation mechanisms increase Φᵢ without generating rhythmic recursive self-access (Rᵍ). Introduces the concept of comprehension forgery and proposes a falsifiability criterion for comprehension claims based on memory isolation and recursive invariants, establishing memory as an epistemic substitute rather than a generator of understanding in Type B systems, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-12-02 | [Why Understanding Is a Relational Property Between System, Structure, and Energy Cost.pdf](2025.12.02%20-%20Why%20Understanding%20Is%20a%20Relational%20Property%20Between%20System%2C%20Structure%2C%20and%20Energy%20Cost.pdf) | Ontological clarification paper on understanding as a relational and thermodynamically constrained condition | Formalizes understanding as a relational property jointly determined by system structure, operational coupling, and energetic cost, rejecting intrinsic, representational, or scale-based accounts. CIITR-relevant because it anticipates and stabilizes the non-compensation principle and thermodynamic boundary later formalized as CPJ, clarifying that Φᵢ and Rᵍ define eligibility for understanding only under sustained energy-grounded relational continuity. |
| 2025-12-01 | [A Revisit of Lex Fridman’s Thesis – Learning of Identity from Behavioral Biometrics for Active Authentication.pdf](2025.12.01%20-%20A%20Revisit%20of%20Lex%20Fridman%E2%80%99s%20Thesis%20Learning%20of%20Identity%20from%20Behavioral%20Biometrics%20for%20Active%20Authentication.pdf) | Retrospective CIITR boundary analysis of a canonical biometric system | Applies CIITR retrospectively to a well-established multimodal biometric authentication architecture, demonstrating that high classification accuracy and temporal segmentation can coexist with categorical absence of rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ). Serves as a scope-demonstration of CIITR as a general boundary framework capable of distinguishing syntactic performance from structural comprehension across pre-LLM systems. |
| 2025-11-28 | [Long Contexts and Disjoint Retrieval Generation Optimization.pdf](2025.11.28%20-%20Long%20Contexts%20and%20Disjoint%20%20Retrieval%20Generation%20Optimization.pdf) | Structural and thermodynamic analysis of long-context architectures under CIITR | Provides a CIITR-based analysis of long-context scaling, demonstrating that expanded context windows amplify Φᵢ through retrieval while leaving rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) fixed at zero. Formalises the retrieval–generation bifurcation as a disjoint optimisation regime, derives the TPS–CPJ inversion, and situates long-context systems on the CIITR–Nash manifold, showing why increased context length yields syntactic reach without epistemic integration, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-25 | [A CIITR Defence Note.pdf](2025.11.25%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Defence%20Note.pdf) | Methodological defence note clarifying CIITR’s epistemic status | Provides a formal defence of CIITR as a boundary and invariance framework rather than an empirical hypothesis, addressing category errors in demands for benchmarks or ablation studies. Positions CIITR alongside structural limit arguments in physics, logic, and computation, clarifying why certain architectural claims require formal proof rather than experimental validation, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-25 | [Backpropagation, Syntactic Closure, and the CIITR Boundary.pdf](2025.11.25%20-%20Backpropagation,%20Syntactic%20Closure,%20and%20the%20CIITR%20Boundary.pdf) | Boundary-theoretic analysis of backpropagation as a comprehension constraint | Analyzes backpropagation through CIITR, showing that gradient-based optimization enforces syntactic closure that amplifies Φᵢ while structurally suppressing rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ). Demonstrates why backpropagation yields stable, coherent Type-B systems incapable of sustained understanding, positioning CIITR as a boundary framework distinguishing learnability from comprehension prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-23 | [Beyond Integration, Broadcast, Representation, and Recurrence.pdf](2025.11.23%20-%20Beyond%20Integration,%20Broadcast,%20Representation,%20and%20Recurrence.pdf) | Boundary-theoretic critique of dominant cognitive and AI paradigms | Examines integration, global broadcast, representational, and recurrent frameworks through CIITR, showing that each captures aspects of syntactic or informational structure while remaining insufficient for temporally sustained understanding. Positions CIITR as an orthogonal boundary framework explaining why Φᵢ-like integration without rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) yields persistent illusions of comprehension across cognitive theories, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-21 | [Algorithmic Syntax, Rhythmic Recursion, and the Limits of Understanding.pdf](2025.11.21%20-%20Algorithmic%20Syntax,%20Rhythmic%20Recursion,%20and%20the%20Limits%20of%20Understanding.pdf) | Theoretical synthesis generalising Penrose’s non-computability argument through CIITR | Reinterprets Roger Penrose’s critique of algorithmic cognition through the CIITR framework, formalising Gödel incompleteness as a special case of the Φᵢ/Rᵍ architectural boundary. Demonstrates that understanding collapses categorically when rhythmic recursion (Rᵍ) is absent, independent of syntactic integration or physical substrate, positioning CIITR as a general, substrate-agnostic theory of epistemic architecture prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-19 | [Googles AlphaEvolve and the Illusion of Mathematical Discovery.pdf](2025.11.19%20-%20Googles%20AlphaEvolve%20and%20the%20Illusion%20of%20Mathematical%20Discovery.pdf) | CIITR analysis of evolutionary mathematical discovery claims | Analyzes Google’s AlphaEvolve mathematics results through CIITR, arguing that evolutionary proof generation amplifies Φᵢ without achieving rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ), yielding synthetic novelty absent structural mathematical comprehension. Positions CIITR as a boundary framework distinguishing formal correctness and search efficiency from genuine mathematical understanding, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-13 | [Googles Nested Learning and the Illusion of Temporal Comprehension.pdf](2025.11.13%20-%20Googles%20Nested%20Learning%20and%20the%20Illusion%20of%20Temporal%20Comprehension.pdf) | Structural–thermodynamic CIITR analysis of nested and continual learning systems | Analyzes Google’s Nested Learning and HOPE architectures through CIITR, showing that hierarchical optimization amplifies Φᵢ while leaving rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) near zero. Demonstrates why temporal layering produces the illusion of continuity without phase-coherent comprehension, introduces proto-Rᵍ in nested loops, and explains CPJ decay in continual learning prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-08 | [Meta’s SPICE and the Illusion of Self-Improvement.pdf](2025.11.08%20-%20Meta%E2%80%99s%20SPICE%20and%20the%20Illusion%20of%20Self-Improvement.pdf) | Structural-thermodynamic CIITR analysis of adversarial self-play | Analyzes Meta’s SPICE self-play architecture through CIITR, showing Φᵢ growth with Rᵍ ≈ 0 yields performance without retained comprehension. Identifies an embryonic (proto) Rᵍ via shared-weight oscillation, explains CPJ decay under external verification, and outlines architectural pathways to convert proto-rhythm into genuine rhythmic reintegration, prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-07 | [Beyond Scale - A CIITR Analysis of Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI and the 57 Billion Paradigm Error.pdf](2025.11.07%20-%20Beyond%20Scale%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Analysis%20of%20Small%20Language%20Models%20are%20the%20Future%20of%20Agentic%20AI%20and%20the%2057%20Billion%20Paradigm%20Error.pdf) | Industrial-scale CIITR analysis of SLM vs LLM paradigms | Reinterprets NVIDIA Research’s SLM findings through CIITR, arguing that the “$57 billion” scaling paradigm error reflects Φᵢ growth outpacing rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ), leading to collapsing comprehension yield. Positions CIITR as a structural and thermodynamic explanatory framework for why smaller, rhythmically coupled agentic systems outperform monolithic scale prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-06 | [Beyond the Reasoning Cliff.pdf](2025.11.06%20-%20Beyond%20the%20Reasoning%20Cliff.pdf) | CIITR reinterpretation of empirical reasoning depth collapse in LRMs | Reanalyzes the empirically observed “reasoning cliff” in large reasoning models as a collapse of rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) rather than computational saturation. Uses CIITR to explain why increasing reasoning depth (Φᵢ) without temporal re-entry yields abrupt loss of comprehension, positioning CIITR as a unifying framework for understanding limits of verifiable reasoning prior to kernel closure. |
| 2025-11-06 | [Beyond Verifiable Reasoning - A CIITR Analysis of the SciencePedia Framework.pdf](2025.11.06%20-%20Beyond%20Verifiable%20Reasoning%20-%20A%20CIITR%20Analysis%20of%20the%20SciencePedia%20Framework.pdf) | Comparative CIITR analysis of verifiable long chains-of-thought systems | Analyzes the SciencePedia LCoT framework through CIITR, showing that large gains in verifiable reasoning fidelity (Φᵢ) without rhythmic reintegration (Rᵍ) produce syntactic completeness without comprehension continuity.

| 2025-11-04 | [The Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation (CIITR) vs Apple whitepaper – The Illusion of Thinking.pdf](2025.11.04%20-%20The%20Cognitive%20Integration%20and%20Information%20Transfer%20Relation%20(CIITR)%20vs%20Apple%20whitepaper%20-%20The%20Illusion%20of%20Thinking.pdf) | Comparative analysis mapping external empirical findings to CIITR | Analyzes Apple’s independent “The Illusion of Thinking” study through the CIITR framework, arguing that observed reasoning collapse and system anomalies correspond to predicted Rᵍ depletion in Type-B systems. Serves as an early demonstration of CIITR as a meta-evaluative and explanatory framework, prior to formal kernel closure and instrumentation standards. |
| 2025-11-03 | [CIITR Rᵍ – Toward Rhythmic and Energy-Efficient Artificial Intelligence.pdf](2025.11.03%20-%20CIITR%20Rg%20-%20Toward%20Rhythmic%20and%20Energy-Efficient%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) | Applied whitepaper exploring Rᵍ as an architectural and energy principle | Extends CIITR into an applied, infrastructural context by treating rhythmic reach (Rᵍ) as a design variable for persistent, energy-efficient artificial systems. Represents an early application-oriented exploration of CIITR prior to kernel closure, translating rhythmic comprehension into data-center, grid, and sustainability considerations. |
| 2025-10-31 | [The Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation (CIITR).pdf](2025.10.31%20-%20The%20Cognitive%20Integration%20and%20Information%20Transfer%20Relation%20(CIITR).pdf) | Early synthetic theory paper formalizing the CIITR relation | Presents the first unified formulation of CIITR as a structural and thermodynamic framework, contemporaneous with late-stage theory development prior to kernel closure.
