# CIITR-Related Papers and Articles (Chronological Register)

This page provides a chronological register of papers, theory notes, and articles that are directly or indirectly related to the development and application of CIITR.

The documents listed here reflect the historical evolution of ideas associated with CIITR.  
Inclusion in this register does **not** imply kernel-level conformity unless explicitly stated.  
Each entry is described according to its structural role and relevance *at the time of writing*.

The list is ordered chronologically, with the most recent documents at the top and the earliest works at the bottom.

| File | Theory note / paper / article synopsis | Description / argument why CIITR relevant |
|------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| [2025.11.04 – The Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation (CIITR) vs Apple whitepaper – The Illusion of Thinking.pdf](2025.11.04%20-%20The%20Cognitive%20Integration%20and%20Information%20Transfer%20Relation%20(CIITR)%20vs%20Apple%20whitepaper%20-%20The%20Illusion%20of%20Thinking.pdf) | Comparative analysis mapping external empirical findings to CIITR | Analyzes Apple’s independent “The Illusion of Thinking” study through the CIITR framework, arguing that observed reasoning collapse and effort anomalies correspond to predicted Rᵍ depletion in Type-B systems. Serves as an early demonstration of CIITR as a meta-evaluative and explanatory framework, prior to formal kernel closure and instrumentation standards. |
| [2025.11.03 – CIITR–Rᵍ: Toward Rhythmic and Energy-Efficient Artificial Intelligence.pdf](2025.11.03%20-%20CIITR%E2%80%93R%E1%B5%8D%3A%20Toward%20Rhythmic%20and%20Energy-Efficient%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) | Applied whitepaper exploring Rᵍ as an architectural and energy principle | Extends CIITR into an applied and infrastructural context by treating rhythmic reach (Rᵍ) as a design variable for persistent, energy-efficient artificial systems. Represents an early application-oriented exploration of CIITR prior to kernel closure, translating rhythmic comprehension into data-center, grid, and sustainability considerations. |
| [2025.10.31 – The Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation (CIITR).pdf](2025.10.31%20-%20The%20Cognitive%20Integration%20and%20Information%20Transfer%20Relation%20(CIITR).pdf) | Early synthetic theory paper formalizing the CIITR relation | Presents the first unified formulation of CIITR as a structural and thermodynamic framework, contemporaneous with late-stage theory development prior to kernel closure. Establishes the Φᵢ–Rᵍ relation, the orthogonality barrier, and early links to thermodynamic persistence, serving as a bridge between conceptual forerunners and the later CIITR Core Specification. |
| [2025.10.26 – The CIITR Self-Declarations – A Structural Discovery in Artificial Intelligence.pdf](2025.10.26%20-%20The%20CIITR%20Self-Declarations%20%E2%80%93%20A%20Structural%20Discovery%20in%20Artificial%20Intelligence.pdf) | Exploratory comparative paper using CIITR grammar for model self-description | Documents an early structural experiment in which multiple large language models describe their own architectures using CIITR concepts. Serves as a contemporaneous probe of CIITR as a shared introspective grammar, preceding formal kernel closure, instrumentation rules, and negative-evidence constraints. |
| [2025.10.22 – The reflexive limit of artificial intelligence.pdf](2025.10.22%20-%20The%20reflexive%20limit%20of%20artificial%20intelligence.pdf) | Early conceptual essay on reflexivity, temporal structure, and limits of inference in artificial systems | Articulates the integration–reach distinction and the snapshot limitation problem contemporaneously with early CIITR development, prior to kernel formalization. Serves as a conceptual precursor to later CIITR principles concerning non-compensation, temporal invariance, and the separation between internal integration and externally coupled rhythmic re-entry. |

### Notes on interpretation

- Entries classified as *early*, *exploratory*, or *conceptual* should be read as part of the formative phase of CIITR, not as applications of a finalized kernel.
- Later theory notes and papers may explicitly reference the CIITR Kernel or Core Specification and will be described accordingly.
- No document listed here is retroactively modified to satisfy later formal criteria.
