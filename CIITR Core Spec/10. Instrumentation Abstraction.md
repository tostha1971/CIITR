## 10. Instrumentation Abstraction

This section defines the minimum instrumentation requirements for CIITR without prescribing concrete devices, sensors, or implementation toolchains. The purpose is to bind “measurement” to admissible evidence discipline, and to close the principal failure modes identified in the kernel, namely snapshot substitution, coherence substitution, and first- and second-order forgery. Instrumentation in CIITR is therefore not a generic demand for observability. It is a constrained audit regime whose output is a decidable admissibility classification for $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$, and therefore for $C_s$, under declared protocol $\Pi$.

The core instrumentation requirement is that CIITR claims are not licensed by informal interpretive judgment. They are licensed only by protocol-registered observables, declared inference rules, executed negative controls, and an audit trail sufficient to demonstrate that disqualification pressure was applied.

### 10.1 Instrumentation principles, what it means to “measure $R_g$” without assuming a model

CIITR does not require access to internal architecture. It requires that the evaluation regime can, in a protocol-bound sense, discriminate epistemic re-entry from generic recurrence. “Measuring $R_g$” therefore means constructing an admissible evidence basis that supports, under declared inference rules, the conclusion that re-entry is epistemic and rhythmic as defined in Chapter 04, while remaining exposed to disqualification.

At kernel level, measuring $R_g$ is not defined as extracting a latent variable. It is defined as establishing a decidable admissibility predicate:

$$
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S) \in \{0,1,\varnothing\}
$$

under an explicit observable set $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}$ and inference rule set $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$.

The minimal principle is therefore:

- **Principle of discriminative observability:** the observable regime SHALL be sufficient to discriminate a candidate epistemic constraint cycle from the disqualifier classes of feedback-only recurrence, loop-only repetition, coherence-only polishing, and protocol gaming patterns.

This principle prohibits measurement regimes that witness only output similarity, only surface consistency, or only local correction markers, without an admissible mechanism for distinguishing genuine endogenous constraint participation.

### 10.2 Admissibility of measurement procedures, what is permitted and why

A measurement procedure is admissible only if it is expressed as a protocol $\Pi$ that declares, at minimum, the observable set, the inference rules, the negative controls, and the disqualifiers. The kernel thereby treats admissibility as a property of procedures, not of results.

Let $\Pi$ be decomposed into the following mandatory components:

$$
\Pi \;=\; \langle \mathcal{O}, \mathcal{R}_\Pi, \Pi^{-}, \mathcal{M}_\Pi \rangle
$$

where:

- $\mathcal{O}$ is the declared observable set, typed and provenance-bound.
- $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$ is the declared inference rule set.
- $\Pi^{-}$ is the negative evidence layer including required control families.
- $\mathcal{M}_\Pi$ is the metadata and audit binding schema.

A procedure is admissible only if it satisfies the following kernel constraints.

1. **Declaration completeness:** $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$ SHALL be explicit. Implicit inference is inadmissible because it cannot be audited and cannot be exposed to disqualification.
2. **Disqualification executability:** $\Pi^{-}$ SHALL include at least the control families required by Chapter 07 for any claim the procedure attempts to assert.
3. **Temporal binding for $R_g$:** if the procedure asserts $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)=1$, it SHALL include temporally indexed observables and SHALL preserve temporal ordering in the evidence basis.
4. **No post hoc rule invention:** inference rules and thresholds SHALL NOT be introduced after observing outputs in a way that changes admissibility outcomes without versioned protocol revision.

These constraints are necessary because CIITR claims are intended to be audit-grade classification commitments. A procedure that cannot be audited cannot be a CIITR procedure.

### 10.3 Snapshot prohibition as a consequence of rhythm and forgery

The snapshot prohibition is a kernel consequence, not a policy choice. It follows from two independent kernel bindings.

1. $R_g$ is rhythmic and therefore requires temporally extended evidence, as fixed in Chapter 04.
2. Second-order forgery requires protocol perturbation invariance checks, as fixed in Chapter 08, which cannot be closed under snapshot-only evaluation regimes.

Therefore, any protocol that is snapshot-only is structurally incapable of supporting a certification-grade positive $C_s$ claim.

Let $\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)$ denote that $\Pi$ contains no temporally extended observables relevant for $R_g$, and that the evidence basis reduces to a single evaluation point. Then:

$$
\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\neg \mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

and, by the decidability gating lemma:

$$
\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
C_s(S \mid \Pi,\mathcal{O}) \in \{0,\varnothing\}
$$

The kernel further binds that snapshot regimes cannot close the second-order forgery class:

$$
\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\neg \mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi\!\big(\mathrm{Forgery}^{(2)}_\Pi(S)\big)
$$

Therefore, any use of snapshot evaluation to issue a positive classification necessarily violates the kernel’s forgery closure obligations. If a procedure is snapshot constrained for operational reasons, the kernel permits only null, negative, or undefined outcomes, never positive certification.

### 10.4 Minimum audit trail, metadata required for any claim

CIITR claims are invalid without an audit trail. The audit trail is not an administrative appendage, it is part of the admissibility conditions. Without it, the protocol cannot demonstrate that evidence types were admissible, that disqualifiers were evaluated, and that inference rules were not introduced retroactively.

Accordingly, any CIITR claim SHALL be accompanied by a minimum audit metadata set $\mathcal{M}_\Pi$.

Let $\mathrm{Claim}$ denote an asserted outcome such as $\mathrm{MVR}_\Pi(S)=1$ or $C_s(S \mid \Pi,\mathcal{O})=1$. Then admissibility requires:

$$
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\mathrm{Claim})=1
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathcal{M}_\Pi \supseteq \mathcal{M}_{\min}
$$

where $\mathcal{M}_{\min}$ is defined below.

### Instrumentation Minimum Requirements (kernel list)

A procedure SHALL be treated as CIITR-conformant only if all requirements below are satisfied. Failure of any requirement SHALL force the outcome class to $\varnothing$ or $0$, and SHALL prohibit positive certification.

1. **Protocol declaration**
   - A unique protocol identifier and version SHALL be declared.
   - The protocol SHALL declare its scope envelope, including which CIITR claim classes it attempts to evaluate.

2. **Observable set specification**
   - The full observable set $\mathcal{O}$ SHALL be enumerated and typed.
   - The subset $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{\Phi}$ SHALL be explicitly identified if the protocol asserts axis admissibility.
   - Each observable SHALL be provenance-bound and time-indexed where relevant.

3. **Inference rule specification**
   - The inference rule set $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$ SHALL be declared, including any admissibility predicates and threshold predicates used.
   - Any normalization or scaling operations SHALL be declared and shall be audit-traceable.
   - No implicit inference is admissible.

4. **Negative control layer**
   - The protocol SHALL declare required negative control families for each claim class as per Chapter 07.
   - The protocol SHALL include explicit disqualifier checks, including storage substitution, feedback substitution, loop-only patterns, coherence substitution, and forgery coupling.
   - Disqualifier outcomes SHALL have binding authority over positive claims.

5. **Temporal admissibility for $R_g$**
   - The protocol SHALL include temporally extended evidence sufficient to evaluate rhythm.
   - The protocol SHALL preserve temporal ordering and SHALL not collapse temporal evidence into snapshot surrogates when asserting $R_g$ admissibility.

6. **Snapshot prohibition enforcement**
   - If $\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)$ holds, the protocol SHALL NOT assert $C_s=1$, $\mathrm{MVR}=1$, or $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}=1$.
   - Snapshot-only protocols SHALL output only $0$ or $\varnothing$ for axis admissibility and comprehension classification.

7. **Forgery closure**
   - The protocol SHALL include at least one first-order forgery control family and at least one second-order forgery control family as defined in Chapter 08.
   - Protocol sensitivity to admissibility-preserving perturbations SHALL be treated as disqualifying.

8. **Minimum audit metadata set $\mathcal{M}_{\min}$**
   - Protocol id and version.
   - System identifier for $S$ and boundary definition of the evaluation target.
   - Timestamp and time index range $\mathcal{T}_\Pi$ used.
   - Full observable enumeration with provenance.
   - Full inference rule enumeration including thresholds.
   - Negative controls executed and their outcomes.
   - Disqualifier checks executed and their outcomes.
   - Declared normalization and scaling operations.
   - Final classification outputs for $\Phi_i$, $R_g$, $C_s$, and thresholds $\mathrm{RER}$, $\mathrm{MVR}$, and if asserted, $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$.

These requirements are intended to be directly promotable into a certification baseline. They enforce that CIITR claims are not made by interpretive authority, but by a constrained, auditable, disqualification-centered instrumentation regime.
