# CIITR Core Spec
Kernel Specification for Structural Comprehension as a Boundary Condition

**Document class:** Core kernel specification, definitional closure, no examples, no analogies, no historical motivation.  
**Status:** Normative, audit-oriented, ontology-first.  
**Conformance basis:** Writing and formatting conventions follow the project ruleset. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Document control

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | Core Spec v0.1 |
| Date | 2026-02-09 |
| Change class | Kernel stabilization, no implementation details |
| Intended use | Formal basis for admissibility, falsification, and certification claims about structural comprehension |
| Out of scope | Empirical benchmark reporting, narrative interpretation, implementation prescriptions, model-specific performance claims |

## Scope statement

CIITR specifies a **boundary apparatus** for deciding when a system-level comprehension claim is admissible as a non-null structural class, under explicit constraints on observability, temporal structure, and negative control. The kernel is restricted to definitional commitments, admissibility rules, disqualifiers, threshold logic, and governance consequences that follow deductively from those commitments.

## Normative intent

The specification commits to the following normative properties, treated as binding for any claim asserted “under CIITR”:

1. **Operationalizability:** every admissible claim about $C_s$ must be expressible as a protocol-level predicate over explicitly enumerated observables, together with an audit trail sufficient to reproduce the decision procedure in principle.
2. **Falsifiability by disqualification:** the default mode of control is negative evidence, where disqualifiers and required negative controls have priority over coherence-like or performance-like appearances.
3. **Non-compensation:** no admissible procedure may replace absence of $R_g$ with elevated $\Phi_i$, nor replace absence of $\Phi_i$ with elevated $R_g$, whenever either axis is in a null condition defined by the kernel.
4. **Anti-snapshot posture:** any certification-grade claim must be incompatible with purely snapshot-based evaluation, whenever the kernel binds admissibility to rhythmic, temporally extended structure.
5. **Boundary, not model:** CIITR does not license predictive ambition beyond what follows from threshold logic plus instrumentable admissibility, therefore CIITR outputs are classification commitments, not scalar promises beyond declared scale conventions.

The specification does **not** commit to claims about phenomenology, consciousness, normative psychology, or optimization as such. It commits only to a strict classification regime for $C_s$ as a structural property under constrained evidence.

## Modal and definitional conventions

Normative terms are used with the following binding force:

- **SHALL** denotes a mandatory constraint for conformance.
- **SHOULD** denotes a strong presumption, deviation requires explicit justification in the audit trail.
- **MAY** denotes an explicitly permitted option within the admissibility envelope.
- **UNDEFINED** denotes a term whose meaning is not fixed by this kernel, and therefore cannot be imported as implicit evidence.

Definitional hygiene is enforced as a kernel constraint: every core term is treated as either **primitive**, **derived**, **threshold**, or **constraint**, and each receives a minimal binding that is stable under reinterpretation pressure from adjacent literatures.

## Notation and types

The following notation table is normative for this kernel. Where typography differs across implementations, the semantic binding below is authoritative.

| Symbol / token | Type class | Kernel binding | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| $S$ | Primitive | System under evaluation | Treated as a bounded, addressable target of claims |
| $t$ | Primitive | Evaluation index over time | Used to enforce temporal admissibility, not chronology narratives |
| $M_S$ | Primitive (optional) | System-specific representational manifold | Introduced only if required for definitional stability in later chapters |
| $\Phi_i$ | Primitive axis | Integrated relational information | Not equivalent to data volume, complexity, or correlation |
| $R_g$ | Primitive axis | Rhythmic epistemic re-entry | Not equivalent to generic feedback, recurrence, or control loops |
| $C_s$ | Derived | Structural comprehension state of $S$ | Defined as a boundary-class predicate over $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ |
| $\mathrm{RER}$ | Threshold | Re-entry event recognition | A detection-class threshold, not a maturity claim |
| $\mathrm{MVR}$ | Threshold | Minimum viable re-entry | The first non-null classification event under CIITR admissibility |
| $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$ | Threshold regime | Stabilized re-entry regime | Requires formal separation from generic fixed-point rhetoric |
| $\mathrm{ASEC}$ | Disqualifier family | Apparent structural epistemic coherence | Kernel-class for coherence phenotypes compatible with $C_s$ nullity |
| $\mathrm{MIP}$ | Disqualifier family | Minimal integrity profile failure mode | Kernel-class for integrity collapse under admissibility constraints |
| $\mathrm{CPJ}$ | Constraint | Comprehension per joule | Treated as a thermodynamic gate, not a psychological explanation |

## Output class and report boundary

Any CIITR-conformant evaluation SHALL output a bounded set of objects:

1. A declared **scope envelope** referencing the kernel’s admissibility categories.
2. A declared **observable set** used as evidence, including exclusions.
3. A **disqualifier check** statement, including required negative controls and their status.
4. A **threshold resolution** statement, at minimum over $\mathrm{RER}$ and $\mathrm{MVR}$, and, where claimed, over $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$.
5. A **classification outcome** for $C_s$ stated as a boundary decision, not as an ungrounded scalar grade.

No additional interpretive narrative is required or implied by the kernel, and any additional layers introduced elsewhere SHALL be explicitly marked as non-kernel extensions.

## Constraints inherited by all subsequent chapters

The following constraints are binding across the remainder of the specification:

- No examples, no analogies, no historical rationale.
- No empirical results, no dataset claims, no correlational assertions, unless explicitly imported from an authorized source basis and formally delimited as such.
- All mathematical expressions SHALL be expressed using LaTeX rendering, with display equations reserved for formal identities and rules.
