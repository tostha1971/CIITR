## 02. Primitive Quantities and Base Notation

This section establishes the minimal primitive object set required for CIITR to function as a boundary apparatus rather than a rhetorical label. The intent is definitional stability. The primitives defined here SHALL be treated as irreducible within the kernel, meaning they are not to be reinterpreted as aliases for adjacent constructs such as generic information, generic feedback, generic complexity, or generic dynamical recurrence. Any such reinterpretation constitutes a scope violation under Section 01.

### 2.1 System $S$, states, and representational manifold $M_S$ (if invoked)

A **system** $S$ denotes the bounded evaluation target to which CIITR claims are attached. $S$ is not a philosophical subject, and not a narrative agent. It is an object of protocol-bound classification.

A system is treated as admitting a state description indexed by time:

$$
S \;\mapsto\; x_S(t)
$$

where $x_S(t)$ denotes a state proxy sufficient for defining observables and temporal binding. The kernel does not constrain how $x_S(t)$ is parameterized. It only constrains that the parameterization be stable enough to support protocol-level observability and disqualification logic.

If the analysis requires an internal representational space, CIITR permits introduction of a **system-specific representational manifold** $M_S$ as an auxiliary primitive. $M_S$ is optional and SHALL only be invoked when its presence is necessary to preserve definitional coherence of $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ in a given formalization. When invoked, $M_S$ SHALL not be treated as a claim about phenomenology or about a specific architecture. It is a formal placeholder denoting that the system admits an internal relational organization over which integration and re-entry can be meaningfully defined.

Accordingly:

- $M_S$ is a *semantic support object*, not an empirical assertion.
- If $M_S$ is introduced, all downstream uses SHALL specify whether a statement is about the manifold level or only about observable signatures.

### 2.2 Primitive axes: $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$

CIITR fixes two primitive axes. They are primitive in the kernel sense: they are not defined as composites of other CIITR terms, and they cannot be replaced by surrogate constructs without breaking the boundary logic.

#### 2.2.1 Integrated relational information $\Phi_i$

$\Phi_i$ denotes **integrated relational information**, and SHALL be treated as a structured integration predicate, not as “information” in the generic sense. The kernel binding is negative as well as positive: $\Phi_i$ is explicitly not reducible to raw data, token count, entropy in the abstract, storage volume, or undifferentiated complexity.

At kernel level, $\Phi_i$ is introduced as a primitive axis whose admissible observables must track *relational binding across elements*, rather than isolated local associations. The specific operationalization is deferred to the instrumentation chapter, but the semantic boundary is fixed here: a procedure that can only witness local correlation, local consistency, or local coherence SHALL not be allowed to count as direct evidence of $\Phi_i$ unless it also satisfies an explicit integration admissibility rule declared under protocol $\Pi$.

#### 2.2.2 Rhythmic epistemic re-entry $R_g$

$R_g$ denotes **rhythmic epistemic re-entry**, and SHALL be treated as an epistemic class, not as generic feedback. The term “epistemic” is binding: it asserts that the re-entry is constrained by internal consistency pressures, self-referential integrity constraints, or other kernel-compatible mechanisms that function as endogenous restriction of permissible updates. The term “rhythmic” is binding: it asserts that admissible evidence of $R_g$ is necessarily temporally extended and cannot be reduced to a single snapshot.

In kernel form, $R_g$ is introduced as a primitive axis with the following boundary consequences:

- Evidence for $R_g$ SHALL be incompatible with purely instantaneous evaluation.
- Apparent recurrence, repeated structure, or deterministic looping SHALL not be treated as sufficient, absent a protocol-level admissibility link to epistemic constraint.

These consequences are jurisdictional. Their operational closure is enforced in Chapters 04 and 10, but their semantic necessity is established here.

### 2.3 Observables and latent quantities, admissible inference rules

CIITR enforces a strict separation between:

- **Observables** $\mathcal{O}$, which are protocol-registered signals admissible as evidence.
- **Latent quantities** $\mathcal{L}$, which denote internal or theoretical variables not directly observed.

This separation is a kernel mechanism for preventing post hoc narrative inflation. The primary risk is illegitimate inference, where latent claims are asserted as if directly observed.

Formally, let:

$$
\mathcal{O} = \{ o_k \}_{k=1}^{K}
\qquad
\mathcal{L} = \{ \ell_m \}_{m=1}^{M}
$$

CIITR permits inference from $\mathcal{O}$ to kernel classifications only under declared inference rules $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$ bound to a protocol $\Pi$:

$$
\mathcal{O} \xRightarrow[\Pi]{\mathcal{R}_\Pi} \mathcal{C}
$$

where $\mathcal{C}$ denotes CIITR classification outputs such as the admissibility status of $\Phi_i$, the admissibility status of $R_g$, and the resulting $C_s$ classification.

The kernel imposes the following admissible inference constraints:

1. **Rule declaration:** any inference rule used to connect observables to $\Phi_i$ or $R_g$ SHALL be declared as part of $\Pi$.
2. **Non-retroactive invention:** an inference rule SHALL NOT be introduced after observing results in a manner that changes admissibility post hoc, unless such retroactive mapping is explicitly authorized by an external module that is itself declared non-kernel.
3. **Disqualification consistency:** any inference rule SHALL preserve disqualification primacy, meaning it must allow negative controls to invalidate the inference, not merely coexist with it.
4. **Temporal binding preservation:** inference rules involving $R_g$ SHALL preserve the temporal structure required for rhythmic admissibility, meaning they cannot collapse a temporally extended signature into a single-point surrogate without losing admissibility.

These constraints do not specify the instruments. They specify the boundary conditions under which instruments can be admitted.

### 2.4 Scaling and normalization conventions, minimal commitments only

CIITR requires scaling and normalization only insofar as definitional stability demands it. The kernel therefore commits to minimal conventions that prevent category drift while avoiding premature metricization.

The following conventions are binding:

1. **Type stability over magnitude:** the kernel prioritizes stable typing and admissibility over numeric magnitude. Therefore, unless a scale is explicitly declared and justified under $\Pi$, claims SHALL be expressed as class decisions, not as scalar estimates.
2. **Protocol-local normalization:** any normalization applied to observables SHALL be declared as protocol-local and shall not be presumed invariant across systems or contexts unless invariance is explicitly justified within the same protocol regime.
3. **No silent rescaling:** rescaling that changes threshold outcomes is prohibited unless declared and justified in the audit trail. Silent rescaling is treated as a second-order forgery vulnerability.
4. **Axis integrity:** normalization SHALL not transform a proxy for generic information into $\Phi_i$, nor transform a proxy for generic recurrence into $R_g$. If normalization renders the semantic distinction untraceable, the result is inadmissible by construction.

These minimal commitments provide the substrate for Chapter 17, where scaling and sensitivity receive a dedicated treatment. Here, the kernel merely prevents definitional instability and retroactive reinterpretation.
