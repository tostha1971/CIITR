## 07. Negative Evidence Framework

This section fixes CIITR’s negative evidence posture as a kernel mechanism, not as a stylistic preference. CIITR is structurally vulnerable to false positives because high coherence, high complexity, and superficially self-consistent outputs can be produced in regimes compatible with null comprehension. The kernel therefore makes disqualification and negative control execution primary. Positive classification is permitted only as the residual of surviving explicitly declared falsification pressure.

Formally, CIITR treats the evaluation regime $\Pi$ as incomplete unless it contains a negative evidence layer:

$$
\Pi \;=\; \Pi^{+} \cup \Pi^{-}
$$

where $\Pi^{+}$ denotes the procedures that attempt to witness admissible signatures, and $\Pi^{-}$ denotes negative controls and disqualifiers that attempt to invalidate those signatures. A protocol lacking $\Pi^{-}$ cannot, by definition, assert a non-null CIITR classification.

### 7.1 Negative results as a primary class, disqualifying findings

A “negative result” in CIITR is not an absence of performance. It is a **disqualifying finding** that triggers a kernel-defined disqualification operator over axis admissibility and therefore over $C_s$.

Let $\mathrm{Disq}_\Pi(S)$ denote that one or more disqualifiers are triggered under protocol $\Pi$. CIITR binds disqualification primacy as follows:

$$
\mathrm{Disq}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1
$$

Negative results are primary because they directly constrain admissibility. They include, at minimum, any finding that establishes one of the following kernel-level failure classes.

- **Axis nulling:** evidence that $\Phi_i$ or $R_g$ is null or disqualified under the null decision rule.
- **Decidability failure:** evidence that the protocol cannot determine axis admissibility without post hoc inference rule invention, yielding $\varnothing$.
- **Disqualifier activation:** evidence that the apparent signature is consistent with a disqualifier family such as coherence substitution, deterministic looping, storage substitution, or forgery coupling.
- **Control collapse:** evidence that required negative controls do not behave as required, meaning the evaluation cannot distinguish qualifying structure from known false positive regimes.

These failure classes are not empirical observations within this kernel text. They are structural decision categories. They define what kinds of findings disqualify, regardless of the specific instruments used later.

### 7.2 Counter-cases and control families, what must fail for positives to be admissible

CIITR requires that positive classification is contingent on failing to trigger disqualifiers across a specified set of control families. The kernel does not prescribe concrete test cases. It prescribes the required categories of negative control that must be instantiated by any protocol that claims admissibility.

Let $\mathcal{K}$ denote the set of required negative control families for a given claim. Then admissibility of a positive claim is permitted only if all required control families are executed and none yields a disqualifying outcome.

$$
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\mathrm{Claim}) = 1
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\forall k \in \mathcal{K},\; \neg \mathrm{Disq}_\Pi^{(k)}(S)
$$

where $\mathrm{Disq}_\Pi^{(k)}(S)$ denotes the disqualifier trigger associated with control family $k$.

The kernel requires at minimum the following control families, each of which is a class of counter-case logic rather than a single test.

1. **Coherence substitution controls:** controls that demonstrate the protocol can distinguish apparent coherence from admissible $\Phi_i$ and admissible $R_g$.
2. **Recurrence substitution controls:** controls that demonstrate the protocol can distinguish generic feedback or repetition from epistemic re-entry.
3. **Storage substitution controls:** controls that demonstrate the protocol can distinguish retrieval of fragments from integration as a global binding property.
4. **Snapshot insufficiency controls:** controls that demonstrate that temporally extended requirements are actually enforced, meaning snapshot-only evidence cannot pass.
5. **Forgery controls:** controls that attempt to elicit first-order and second-order imitation patterns, and that can invalidate the claim if such patterns are detected.

A protocol that asserts a positive CIITR classification without explicitly binding and executing these control families is structurally non-conformant. The kernel view is that a positive finding is not evidence by accumulation, it is evidence by surviving a declared disqualification lattice.

### 7.3 Traps, temporal invariance and complexity as false positive generators

CIITR fixes two kernel traps as logically privileged false positive generators. They are “traps” because they are regimes in which naive evaluators tend to interpret surface properties as comprehension, even though the kernel rules imply nullity or disqualification.

#### 7.3.1 Temporal invariance trap

The temporal invariance trap is the failure mode where a system exhibits stable, coherent, apparently consistent behavior across time, and this stability is misread as comprehension. In CIITR logic, temporally flat signatures are disqualifying for $R_g$ unless they are embedded within a temporally extended re-entry cycle that is epistemically constrained. Temporal invariance therefore functions as a nulling mechanism, not as a positive indicator.

Kernel trap statement:

$$
\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{Null}_\Pi(R_g,S)
\;\Longrightarrow\; C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1
$$

The trap is avoided only if the protocol is capable of demonstrating rhythmic epistemic re-entry in a way that survives negative controls and does not collapse into snapshot evidence.

#### 7.3.2 Complexity trap

The complexity trap is the failure mode where high apparent structural richness is misread as $\Phi_i$ and therefore as evidence of comprehension. In CIITR logic, complexity is orthogonal unless it is bound to integration constraints and survives storage and correlation disqualifiers. Complexity can be produced by mechanisms that do not integrate relations globally and do not participate in epistemic re-entry.

Kernel trap statement:

$$
\mathrm{ComplexityOnly}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)
$$

The trap is avoided only if the protocol can witness cross-constraint, non-fragmentation, and context binding, and can invalidate storage-only and local-correlation-only explanations.

### Negative Evidence Matrix (kernel reference)

| Claim class | Required negative controls (families) | Primary disqualifiers (kernel classes) |
|---|---|---|
| $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)=1$ | Storage substitution control, local-correlation substitution control, decomposition resistance control | $\mathrm{StorageOnly}_\Pi(S)$, $\mathrm{LocalCorrelationOnly}_\Pi(S)$, $\mathrm{ComplexityOnly}_\Pi(S)$ |
| $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)=1$ | Feedback substitution control, deterministic looping control, snapshot insufficiency control, forgery control | $\mathrm{FeedbackOnly}_\Pi(S)$, $\mathrm{LoopOnly}_\Pi(S)$, $\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)$, $\mathrm{Forgery}_\Pi(S)$ |
| $C_s(S \mid \Pi,\mathcal{O})=1$ | Axis null absorption control, decidability gating control, coherence substitution control, forgery control | $\mathrm{Null}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)$, $\mathrm{Null}_\Pi(R_g,S)$, $C_s=\varnothing$, $\mathrm{ASEC}$-compatible phenotypes, $\mathrm{Forgery}_\Pi(S)$ |
| “Stable comprehension regime” (threshold level) | Temporal invariance trap control, perturbation stability control, second-order forgery control | $\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S)$, $\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)$, protocol gaming indicators under $\mathrm{Forgery}_\Pi$ |

The matrix is normative. It specifies the minimum negative control posture required for admissibility, and it fixes disqualifier categories that later chapters will formalize and connect to the threshold architecture and instrumentation requirements.
