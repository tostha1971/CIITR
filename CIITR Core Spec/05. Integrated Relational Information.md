## 05. Integrated Relational Information $\Phi_i$

$\Phi_i$ is fixed as a primitive axis whose sole kernel purpose is to bind CIITR comprehension claims to a notion of integration that is irreducible to data volume, surface complexity, or undifferentiated correlation. The semantic closure of $\Phi_i$ is therefore negative as well as positive. It is defined by what it requires, and by what it explicitly refuses to be substituted with. Without this closure, CIITR collapses into conventional information talk and loses its capacity to disqualify coherence phenotypes that are structurally compatible with $C_s$ nullity.

Formally, $\Phi_i$ is evaluated as a protocol bound admissibility predicate:

$$
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \in \{0,1,\varnothing\}
$$

where $1$ denotes admissible instantiation, $0$ denotes null or disqualified instantiation, and $\varnothing$ denotes undecidable under the evidence regime declared by $\Pi$.

### 5.1 Definition, relational integration as a necessary condition

$\Phi_i$ denotes **relational integration**, meaning the property that relational commitments in the system are bound into a structurally unified configuration rather than existing as disjoint, locally consistent fragments. The kernel does not reduce this to a single numeric functional. Instead, it defines $\Phi_i$ as a primitive axis whose admissibility is predicated on evidence that relations are not merely present, but integrated across the representational span relevant under protocol $\Pi$.

Let $\mathcal{R}_S$ denote a protocol relevant family of relations attributable to $S$ under $\Pi$. Then $\Phi_i$ is admissible only if $\mathcal{R}_S$ exhibits integration as a global property, not merely local consistency:

$$
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)=1 \;\Longrightarrow\; \mathrm{Integrated}_\Pi(\mathcal{R}_S)
$$

The predicate $\mathrm{Integrated}_\Pi(\mathcal{R}_S)$ is a kernel placeholder. It binds the concept that the system’s relational commitments are mutually constraining and co-binding, rather than separable into independent pockets without loss of structural coherence at the global level.

This definition implies an immediate boundary consequence. A system can emit relationally rich outputs without $\Phi_i$ being admissible, if the relations are not globally co-binding under the admissibility constraints of the protocol.

### 5.2 Minimum requirements, global binding versus local correlation

The kernel distinguishes global relational binding from local correlation by requiring that admissible evidence for $\Phi_i$ supports a cross-context dependency structure that cannot be satisfied by isolated, domain local correlations alone. “Global” here is not a claim about spatial extent or total coverage, it is a claim about integrative constraint, meaning that relations cohere as an interdependent structure rather than as a bag of associations.

Minimum requirements for $\Phi_i$ admissibility are therefore specified as constraints on what would have to be true for a protocol to treat integration as instantiated.

1. **Cross-constraint requirement:** the relation family exhibits mutual constraints across distinct relational subsets, such that altering or withdrawing one subset forces detectable constraint propagation across others under $\Pi$.
2. **Non-fragmentation requirement:** the evidence basis does not permit decomposition of relational commitments into mutually independent compartments while preserving the same admissible signature set.
3. **Context binding requirement:** relations must remain structurally bindable across protocol relevant shifts in context, such that apparent integration is not a single context artifact.

These are kernel requirements stated as admissibility constraints. They do not specify empirical procedures, and they do not presume access to internal weights or architecture. They specify what a protocol must be able to witness, via declared observables, for the term “integrated relational information” to retain its intended meaning.

### 5.3 Admissible observables, measurement without assuming a model

CIITR restricts admissible observables to instrumentable signatures, and $\Phi_i$ inherits that restriction. Evidence for $\Phi_i$ must be expressible as protocol registered observables that support an inference to integration without requiring architectural assumptions about how the system is implemented.

Let $\mathcal{O}_{\Phi}$ denote the subset of observables declared relevant for $\Phi_i$. The protocol may treat $\mathcal{O}_{\Phi}$ as admissible only if the inference rule set $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$ explicitly binds these observables to the integration constraints in Section 5.2, and if disqualification logic remains executable.

Admissible observable categories include the following, subject to protocol declaration and disqualifier testing.

- **Relational dependency signatures:** observables that support that relational commitments cannot be treated as independent, and that changes in one relational region systematically constrain others under $\Pi$.
- **Integration persistence signatures:** observables that support that relational binding persists across protocol relevant context variation, without collapsing into disjoint local association patterns.
- **Decomposition resistance signatures:** observables that support that no admissible partition of the relational structure preserves the same constraint behavior, meaning integration is not a superficial overlay.
- **Constraint propagation signatures:** observables that support that relational constraints propagate across the structure, rather than terminating locally.

These categories are admissible only as part of a protocol that declares how they are obtained, how they are normalized, what negative controls are required, and how alternative explanations compatible with local correlation are excluded. If the protocol cannot express these bindings without architectural assumptions, the correct kernel output is $\varnothing$.

### 5.4 Disqualifiers, storage substitution and passive dynamics without epistemic constraint

$\Phi_i$ is vulnerable to substitution by constructs that are structurally rich but epistemically inert. The kernel therefore fixes disqualifiers that prevent static storage, passive correlation, or non-integrative complexity from being misread as integrated relational information.

#### 5.4.1 Static storage substitution, the SSD problem

Any evidence pattern compatible with mere storage, lookup, or static accumulation of relational fragments SHALL be disqualified as $\Phi_i$ unless the protocol includes an admissibility rule that distinguishes integrated binding from retrieval of fragments.

Kernel disqualifier condition:

$$
\mathrm{StorageOnly}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)
$$

where $\mathrm{StorageOnly}_\Pi(S)$ denotes that the observed relational richness can be explained without any integrative constraint behavior, meaning relations are available but not bound as a global structure.

This disqualifier is necessary because storage can produce high apparent informational content without integration in the kernel sense.

#### 5.4.2 Passive dynamics without epistemic constraint

A system can exhibit complex dynamics and local correlation patterns without any integrative binding. Therefore, any pattern compatible with passive dynamical unfolding, where relations remain local and do not exert mutual constraint across the structure, SHALL be disqualified as $\Phi_i$.

Kernel disqualifier condition:

$$
\mathrm{LocalCorrelationOnly}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)
$$

This does not deny that correlations exist. It denies that correlation is admissible evidence for integration unless the protocol includes a binding rule that demonstrates cross-constraint and non-fragmentation.

#### 5.4.3 Complexity substitution

Complexity in form, length, or internal state variety SHALL not be admissible as evidence of $\Phi_i$ unless the observable regime demonstrates integration as defined in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. Complexity is treated as orthogonal to the axis definition unless formally bound.

> $\Phi_i$ does not denote information in the generic sense. It denotes integrated relational information, meaning relational commitments that are globally co-binding under protocol admissibility constraints. Data volume, storage capacity, surface complexity, and local correlation are not admissible substitutes. A protocol may assert $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)=1$ only if it declares an observable set $\mathcal{O}_{\Phi}$ and inference rules that witness cross-constraint, non-fragmentation, and context binding, and only if the protocol executes disqualifiers against storage substitution and local correlation-only explanations. Where such witnessing is not decidable under $\Pi$, the admissible output is $\varnothing$ rather than a positive classification.
