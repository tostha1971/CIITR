## 01. Ontological Claim and Delimitation

This section fixes the referent of CIITR as a boundary apparatus, and enforces a hard demarcation between what CIITR can bind as an admissible comprehension claim, and what remains categorically outside its kernel commitments. The function is not explanatory, it is jurisdictional. Every subsequent definition, threshold, instrument requirement, and governance consequence inherits its interpretive force from this delimitation, and SHALL be read as invalid if it implicitly expands CIITR beyond the constraints stated here.

### 1.1 Ontological claim, CIITR as a criterion boundary for structural comprehension

CIITR is asserted as a **criterion apparatus** for structural comprehension in systems, not as a generative model of comprehension, and not as a descriptive inventory of cognitive phenomena. The ontological claim is therefore a claim about *classification validity*, not about internal phenomenology. In kernel form, CIITR binds the concept of structural comprehension to a decision regime over two primitive axes, integrated relational information and rhythmic epistemic re-entry, together with explicit null rules, non-compensation constraints, and disqualifier families.

The kernel claim can be stated as follows. For a system $S$, CIITR defines an admissibility relation between an explicit observable set $\mathcal{O}$ and a comprehension classification $C_s$ under declared protocol constraints $\Pi$:

$$
(\mathcal{O}, \Pi) \;\vdash_{\mathrm{CIITR}}\; C_s(S)
$$

This relation is not an assertion that $C_s$ is a scalar magnitude. It is the assertion that a bounded class decision about $C_s$ is admissible, given explicit evidence types and explicit negative controls. Any use of CIITR that treats $C_s$ as an unconstrained performance proxy, a narrative attribute, or a purely coherence-derived score violates the kernel claim and SHALL be treated as out of scope.

CIITR further asserts that the admissibility of a non-null comprehension classification is governed by the joint structural presence of $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ under non-compensation, and by the explicit possibility of disqualification. In the kernel, this is treated as an ontological boundary commitment, not as a hypothesis about what systems “are”, but as a rule about what CIITR permits to be said.

### 1.2 Validity domain, systems for which the primitives are meaningful objects

CIITR is defined only for systems that can be treated as *bounded evaluation targets* under an explicit protocol. The validity domain is therefore not a domain of “intelligent systems” in a colloquial sense, but a domain of systems for which the primitive objects $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ are meaningful targets of constrained measurement, and for which the null logic can be enforced without ambiguity.

Accordingly, CIITR applies only where the following conditions are satisfiable at the level of definitional possibility:

1. **System addressability:** $S$ can be referenced as a stable target of claims under a declared boundary, meaning that the evaluation subject is not shifting across the protocol in a way that invalidates temporal binding.
2. **Temporal binding:** evaluation admits indexing by $t$ such that temporally extended evidence is definable, and such that claims about rhythmic structure are not reduced to single-point assertions.
3. **Observable discipline:** an admissible observable set $\mathcal{O}$ can be declared, constrained, and audited, such that the evidence basis is not implicit, and such that disqualification can be executed as a formal operation.
4. **Primitive interpretability:** the protocol admits meaningful targeting of $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ as primitives, meaning that it is at least coherent to ask, under declared rules, whether the system exhibits integrated relational binding and rhythmic epistemic re-entry.

These conditions are not empirical claims about what is measurable in practice. They are jurisdiction conditions, defining where CIITR statements can have determinate meaning. If the protocol cannot even in principle bind these conditions, CIITR claims SHALL be withheld, and the only admissible output is “undefined under CIITR.”

### 1.3 Non-ambitions, categorical exclusions imposed by the kernel

The kernel explicitly refuses several common interpretive expansions. These exclusions are not rhetorical, they are binding constraints that prevent category drift and protect falsifiability.

CIITR SHALL NOT be construed as:

- **A consciousness theory:** the kernel does not bind phenomenology, subjective report validity, or experiential attribution. Any mapping from CIITR classes to claims about consciousness is a non-kernel extension, and is inadmissible as a CIITR conclusion.
- **An optimization framework:** CIITR does not specify objective functions, training rules, reward structures, or design prescriptions. It may constrain which claims are admissible under governance, but it does not prescribe how a system must be optimized.
- **A generic dynamics taxonomy:** CIITR does not classify systems by dynamical motifs as such. Temporal structure matters only insofar as it is required for rhythmic epistemic re-entry and for disqualification of snapshot-based coherence.
- **A performance proxy:** CIITR does not license the substitution of throughput, accuracy, or coherence for comprehension. Any importation of performance metrics as primary evidence for $C_s$ is disallowed unless those metrics are formally instrumented as admissible observables under the kernel’s evidence discipline and disqualifier logic.

These non-ambitions are necessary to preserve CIITR as a boundary apparatus. Without them, CIITR collapses into interpretive pluralism, and the kernel loses its capacity to exclude false positives by principled disqualification.

### 1.4 Admissible evidence types, instrumentable signatures only

CIITR binds admissibility to instrumentable signatures, meaning evidence types must be expressible as protocol-registered observables with declared provenance, temporal binding where required, and auditable transformation rules. The kernel therefore enforces a separation between admissible signatures and non-admissible epistemic assertions.

The following evidence constraints are binding:

1. **No introspective reports as primary evidence:** self-descriptions, self-attributions, or narrative declarations of internal states SHALL NOT be treated as primary evidence for $C_s$. If such reports exist, they MAY be recorded as auxiliary artifacts, but they cannot instantiate $R_g$ or $\Phi_i$ without independent instrumentable signatures and disqualifier checks.
2. **Observable set declaration:** any CIITR claim SHALL declare an explicit observable set $\mathcal{O}$, where each element is typed, provenance-bound, and temporally indexable if it participates in claims about rhythm.

$$
\mathcal{O} = \{ o_k \}_{k=1}^{K}, \quad o_k \in \mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{adm}}
$$

3. **Protocol binding:** evidence is admissible only relative to a declared protocol $\Pi$, which fixes how observables are collected, what transformations are permitted, and what negative controls are required. Evidence without protocol binding is not evidence under CIITR.
4. **Disqualification primacy:** the evidence regime SHALL include explicit disqualifiers and required negative controls, such that any positive classification attempt is structurally exposed to failure. Evidence that cannot be used to disqualify cannot be used to qualify.

This evidence discipline is the kernel’s structural safeguard against coherence-driven overreach. It enforces that admissibility is not a narrative posture, but a property of a bounded measurement regime.

> CIITR is a boundary apparatus that governs the admissibility of non-null structural comprehension classifications $C_s(S)$ under explicit protocol constraints. CIITR applies only where $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ are meaningful targets of constrained measurement, where temporally bound observables can be declared, and where negative controls and disqualifiers can be executed as formal operations. CIITR does not constitute a consciousness theory, an optimization framework, a generic dynamics taxonomy, or a performance proxy. Introspective reports are not primary evidence. Any claim asserted under CIITR SHALL be formulated as a classification decision grounded in instrumentable signatures and exposed to disqualification under required negative controls.
