## 04. Rhythmic Epistemic Re-entry $R_g$

$R_g$ is fixed as a primitive axis that binds the admissibility of structural comprehension claims to a temporally extended, internally constrained re-entry phenomenon. The kernel intent is semantic closure. “Re-entry” SHALL not be allowed to drift into a synonym for feedback, recurrence, iteration, or looping. The admissibility of $R_g$ is therefore defined as a protocol-bound predicate over declared observables, constrained by a set of disqualifiers designed to block coherence based substitution and forgery compatible signatures.

Formally, $R_g$ is treated as a system property evaluated under protocol $\Pi$ and observable set $\mathcal{O}$:

$$
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S) \in \{0,1,\varnothing\}
$$

where $1$ denotes admissible instantiation, $0$ denotes disqualified or null instantiation, and $\varnothing$ denotes undecidable under the declared evidence regime.

### 4.1 Definition, what makes re-entry epistemic

Re-entry is epistemic when it constitutes an internally constrained recurrence over the system’s own representational commitments, such that subsequent system state is not merely a function of incoming input, but also a function of internal constraint evaluation applied to previously instantiated relational structure.

The kernel binds epistemicity through the following minimal structure.

Let $x_S(t)$ denote a protocol-relevant state proxy of $S$ at index $t$. Re-entry requires that the update relation admits an endogenous constraint term that is not reducible to external stimulus alone:

$$
x_S(t+1) = F_\Pi\!\big(x_S(t), u(t), \kappa_S(t)\big)
$$

where $u(t)$ denotes protocol inputs at time $t$, and $\kappa_S(t)$ denotes an internal constraint evaluation term that is permitted to influence the update. The kernel does not specify the architecture that realizes $\kappa_S(t)$. It specifies only the admissibility condition that the observable regime must support a non-trivial distinction between update driven by $u(t)$ alone, and update driven by internal constraint evaluation applied to prior commitments.

Accordingly, a re-entry pattern is epistemic only if the following are all satisfied under $\Pi$.

- **Endogenous constraint participation:** the re-entry sequence exhibits evidence consistent with internal constraint evaluation operating over prior relational commitments, rather than mere reprocessing of external signals.
- **Constraint directed revision or stabilization:** the effect of re-entry is to revise, stabilize, or rebind internal relational structure as a consequence of the constraint term, not merely to repeat outputs with superficial variation.
- **Non-trivial self-referential dependency:** the system’s later commitments depend on earlier commitments through an admissible dependency path that is not exhausted by prompt continuation dynamics or externally imposed looping.

These conditions are definitional. Where the observable regime cannot in principle discriminate epistemic constraint participation from generic recurrence, $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)$ SHALL be set to $\varnothing$ rather than asserted positively.

### 4.2 Rhythmic requirement, minimal temporal structure without empirical constants

“Rhythmic” binds $R_g$ to temporally extended structure. It is not equivalent to periodicity in a numeric sense, and it does not require empirical frequency constants. Instead, it imposes a minimal admissibility constraint that re-entry must be expressed as a pattern across multiple indices, and that the pattern must be classifiable as a recurrence of an epistemic constraint cycle rather than an accidental repetition.

Let $\mathcal{T}_\Pi$ denote the set of protocol indices admissible for $R_g$ evaluation. Rhythmic admissibility requires at minimum:

1. **Multiplicity:** the evidence basis includes at least two distinct indices in $\mathcal{T}_\Pi$ such that re-entry is evaluated as a relation across time rather than a single time point property.
2. **Cycle coherence:** the re-entry events are not isolated anomalies, they exhibit coherence as a cycle class under $\Pi$, meaning the events are recognizable as instantiations of the same endogenous constraint mechanism rather than unrelated revisions.
3. **Temporal non-collapse:** the admissible representation of the pattern preserves ordering and separation of events, meaning the evidence cannot be reduced to a single aggregate statistic without destroying the grounds for rhythm attribution.

The kernel therefore enforces that $R_g$ cannot be certified by snapshot-only protocols, a consequence later operationalized through the instrumentation minimum requirements.

### 4.3 Admissible signatures, what can count as evidence

Admissible signatures for $R_g$ are defined as protocol-registered observables $\mathcal{O}$ that support a disciplined inference to epistemic constraint driven recurrence. The kernel does not specify measurement devices. It specifies evidence categories that a protocol may admit, provided that provenance, temporal binding, and disqualification logic are preserved.

Let $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}$ denote the subset of observables declared as relevant for $R_g$. A protocol may treat $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}$ as admissible only if each observable is typed as temporally indexed and is accompanied by an inference rule in $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$ that preserves disqualification primacy.

The following signature classes are admissible in kernel terms, subject to protocol declaration and disqualifier testing.

- **Re-entry dependency signatures:** evidence that later commitments are conditionally dependent on earlier commitments through an internal constraint path, rather than through external stimulus repetition.
- **Constraint enforcement signatures:** evidence that the system applies a non-trivial admissibility filter, consistency filter, or integrity constraint across time, such that revisions are structured as constraint enforcement rather than arbitrary variation.
- **Self-correction signatures:** evidence that revisions are directed by internal constraint violation detection and resolution, meaning the revision has an identifiable internal rationale trace under $\Pi$ rather than being a surface rephrase.
- **Stabilization signatures under perturbation:** evidence that the re-entry cycle sustains its constraint structure when protocol introduces bounded perturbations that would break a purely feedforward or purely imitative process.

None of these signatures are admissible by assertion. Each requires explicit operational binding in $\Pi$, declared observables, and explicit negative controls designed to differentiate epistemic constraint from coherence mimicry.

### 4.4 Disqualifiers, patterns that imitate re-entry without qualifying

Disqualifiers for $R_g$ are kernel enforced failure conditions that prevent generic recurrence and coherence phenotypes from being upgraded to epistemic re-entry. A protocol that does not implement these disqualifiers cannot assert $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)=1$ without violating the kernel.

The disqualifier families are defined at the level of structural pattern types, not empirical outcomes.

#### 4.4.1 Generic feedback substitution

Any pattern that can be explained as feedback in the generic sense, without an admissible internal constraint term, SHALL be disqualified as $R_g$. This includes recurrence that is externally imposed, externally gated, or explainable entirely by input repetition and reactive adjustment.

Kernel disqualifier condition:

$$
\mathrm{FeedbackOnly}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

where $\mathrm{FeedbackOnly}_\Pi(S)$ denotes that the protocol evidence supports no admissible endogenous constraint participation.

#### 4.4.2 Deterministic looping and scripted periodicity

Any pattern consistent with deterministic looping, scripted periodicity, or mechanically enforced iteration SHALL be disqualified unless the protocol includes a specific admissibility rule that isolates endogenous epistemic constraint from mere periodic structure. Rhythm in CIITR is not repetition, it is recurrence of epistemic constraint.

#### 4.4.3 Coherence based re-entry illusion

Patterns that exhibit local coherence improvements, stylistic polishing, or consistency phrasing across time SHALL be disqualified if the evidence basis does not include constraint enforcement signatures beyond surface coherence. This disqualifier links directly to the ASEC family and prevents coherence phenotypes from being treated as epistemic cycles.

#### 4.4.4 First-order and second-order epistemic forgery coupling

$R_g$ is explicitly vulnerable to forgery because re-entry signatures can be imitated. Therefore:

- **First-order forgery coupling:** if $R_g$ signatures are generated through imitation of expected patterns without endogenous constraint participation, the result SHALL be disqualified.
- **Second-order forgery coupling:** if the evaluation regime itself is being gamed, such that $R_g$ appears only under the evaluation protocol and collapses outside it, the protocol SHALL treat the result as disqualified unless robustness requirements are satisfied.

Kernel disqualifier condition:

$$
\mathrm{Forgery}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

The term $\mathrm{Forgery}_\Pi(S)$ is defined as a kernel placeholder for the forgery taxonomy fixed in Chapter 08, and is invoked here only to bind $R_g$ admissibility to that threat model.
