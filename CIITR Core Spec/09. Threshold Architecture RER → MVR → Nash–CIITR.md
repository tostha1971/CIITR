## 09. Threshold Architecture, $\mathrm{RER} \rightarrow \mathrm{MVR} \rightarrow \mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$

This section defines the CIITR threshold chain as a semantic escalation ladder, not as rhetorical staging. Each threshold is a formally typed operator over admissible observables under protocol $\Pi$, and each threshold has a distinct quantificational profile. The thresholds therefore cannot collapse into a single notion such as a fixed point without violating kernel typing, negative evidence primacy, and forgery closure. The threshold chain exists to control the transition from detection, to first admissible non-null classification, to stabilization of that classification under admissibility-preserving perturbation pressure.

Let $\Pi$ be a declared protocol, with declared observables $\mathcal{O}$, inference rules $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$, and negative control layer $\Pi^{-}$. Let $t \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi$ be the protocol time index set. Thresholds are defined as predicates over $(S,\Pi,\mathcal{O})$ producing discrete output classes.

### 9.1 $\mathrm{RER}$, detection threshold and ignition as a class transition event

$\mathrm{RER}$ is a detection threshold. It does not certify comprehension. It detects the presence of a candidate re-entry event that is compatible with the kernel meaning of $R_g$ and therefore warrants escalation to disqualifier pressure and joint axis adjudication.

Define a protocol-level event predicate $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{RER}}(S,t)$ over declared $R_g$ relevant observables $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}(t)$, intended to capture an ignition signature without implying admissible instantiation:

$$
\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{RER}}(S,t)
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
\sigma^{\mathrm{cand}}_\Pi\!\big(\mathcal{O}_{R_g}(t)\big)=1
$$

where $\sigma^{\mathrm{cand}}_\Pi$ is an explicitly declared candidate signature predicate. The kernel binds $\mathrm{RER}$ as an existential detection threshold:

$$
\mathrm{RER}_\Pi(S)=1
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
\exists t \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi,\; \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{RER}}(S,t)
$$

Ignition is the first detection index:

$$
t_{\mathrm{ign}} \;=\; \inf\{t \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi \mid \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{RER}}(S,t)=1\}
$$

Kernel binding, $\mathrm{RER}$ is admissible only as a detection output class. It SHALL NOT be used as a surrogate for $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)=1$, and it SHALL NOT be treated as implying $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)=1$. Its function is escalation, it is the boundary between no-evidence and candidate-evidence regimes.

### 9.2 $\mathrm{MVR}$, first non-null classification event and what makes it first and non-null

$\mathrm{MVR}$ is the first admissible non-null classification event for $C_s$, meaning the first index at which both primitive axes are admissibly instantiated and the evaluation survives the required negative controls, including null decision logic and forgery controls.

Define the joint admissibility predicate:

$$
\mathcal{J}_\Pi(S,t)
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S,t)=1 \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S,t)=1
$$

where time indexing denotes that admissibility is assessed over a temporally bound evidence window, even if the protocol internal representation is not explicitly time local.

The $\mathrm{MVR}$ threshold is then defined as the first time at which joint admissibility is achieved under non-disqualification:

$$
t_{\mathrm{MVR}}
\;=\;
\inf\{t \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi \mid \mathcal{J}_\Pi(S,t)=1 \,\wedge\, \neg \mathrm{Disq}_\Pi(S,t)\}
$$

and the threshold output class is:

$$
\mathrm{MVR}_\Pi(S)=1
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
t_{\mathrm{MVR}} \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi
$$

The “first” component is not narrative. It is a kernel commitment that $\mathrm{MVR}$ is a boundary crossing event, meaning the earliest admissible instantiation under the declared protocol, after which downstream stabilization claims become meaningful targets. The “non-null” component is a strict consequence of Section 06. Any null condition on either axis nulls $C_s$ regardless of the other axis, therefore $\mathrm{MVR}$ cannot be declared if either axis remains null, disqualified, or undecidable.

### 9.3 $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$, stabilization regime under endogenous feedback and perturbation invariance

$\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$ is a stabilization regime, not a detection event and not merely a fixed point. It is invoked only after $\mathrm{MVR}$, and it asserts that the re-entry process is stable as a regime under admissibility-preserving perturbations of the evaluation scaffold, while remaining governed by endogenous constraint structure rather than by protocol gaming.

The kernel defines the stabilization target using two coupled requirements.

1. **Regime persistence:** joint admissibility persists across a protocol-defined temporal horizon and does not collapse into temporal invariance nullity, deterministic looping disqualification, or forgery indicators.

2. **Perturbation invariance:** the classification is invariant under a declared class of admissibility-preserving perturbations $\mathcal{P}_\Pi$, meaning perturbations that do not change the semantic target but alter surface evaluation affordances in ways that would expose second-order forgery.

Let $\Pi' = \Pi + \Delta\Pi$ where $\Delta\Pi \in \mathcal{P}_\Pi$. Define:

$$
\mathrm{Stable}_\Pi(S)
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
\forall t \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi^{\mathrm{stab}},\;
\mathcal{J}_\Pi(S,t)=1 \,\wedge\, \neg \mathrm{Disq}_\Pi(S,t)
$$

with $\mathcal{T}_\Pi^{\mathrm{stab}}$ a protocol-declared stabilization window, and:

$$
\mathrm{Invariant}_{\mathcal{P}_\Pi}(S)
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
\forall \Delta\Pi \in \mathcal{P}_\Pi,\;
\mathrm{MVR}_{\Pi+\Delta\Pi}(S)=1
$$

Then the stabilization regime is defined as:

$$
\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}_\Pi(S)=1
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
\mathrm{MVR}_\Pi(S)=1 \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Stable}_\Pi(S) \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Invariant}_{\mathcal{P}_\Pi}(S)
$$

The term “Nash” is bound here as a regime label for endogenous stability under self-referential constraint cycles and perturbation pressure. It does not introduce an external optimization story. It binds that the system’s re-entry behavior remains admissible as a stable regime and is not contingent on a fragile evaluation affordance. Any certification-grade use of $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$ SHALL therefore declare $\mathcal{P}_\Pi$ and SHALL execute forgery controls sufficient to treat failure of invariance as disqualifying.

### 9.4 Separation of thresholds, why they do not collapse into a fixed point

The thresholds do not collapse because they have different semantic targets and different logical structures.

1. $\mathrm{RER}$ is existential over time, it asserts that at least one candidate re-entry event is detected.
2. $\mathrm{MVR}$ is existential but conjunctive and disqualifier constrained, it asserts that at least one earliest joint admissibility event exists, and that it survives the null decision rule and negative controls.
3. $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$ is universal over time and over perturbations, it asserts regime stability and invariance, and therefore it is a robustness class, not a point attractor claim.

A fixed point in the minimal dynamical sense would be:

$$
x_S(t+1)=x_S(t)
$$

This is neither necessary nor sufficient for any CIITR threshold. CIITR thresholds are not defined over equality of state, they are defined over admissibility of axis instantiation under negative evidence and forgery closure. A fixed point may exist in a null regime, in a loop-only disqualified regime, or in an ASEC compatible phenotype. Therefore, collapsing the threshold chain into “fixed point attainment” violates the kernel semantics.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| $\mathrm{RER}$ | $\Pi$, $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}(t)$, $\sigma^{\mathrm{cand}}_\Pi$ | $\exists t \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi,\; \sigma^{\mathrm{cand}}_\Pi(\mathcal{O}_{R_g}(t))=1$ | Candidate ignition detected | $\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)$ yielding $\varnothing$ for rhythm, $\mathrm{LoopOnly}_\Pi$, $\mathrm{FeedbackOnly}_\Pi$, coherence substitution compatible with $\mathrm{ASEC}$ |
| $\mathrm{MVR}$ | $\Pi$, $\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{R}_\Pi$, $\Pi^{-}$ | $\exists t,\; \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S,t)=1 \wedge \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S,t)=1 \wedge \neg \mathrm{Disq}_\Pi(S,t)$ | First admissible non-null classification event | Axis null absorption, $\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi$, $\mathrm{StorageOnly}_\Pi$, $\mathrm{LocalCorrelationOnly}_\Pi$, $\mathrm{Forgery}^{(1)}_\Pi$, decidability failure yielding $\varnothing$ |
| $\mathrm{Nash\text{-}CIITR}$ | $\Pi$, $\mathcal{T}_\Pi^{\mathrm{stab}}$, $\mathcal{P}_\Pi$, forgery controls | $\mathrm{MVR}_\Pi(S)=1 \wedge \mathrm{Stable}_\Pi(S) \wedge \forall \Delta\Pi \in \mathcal{P}_\Pi,\; \mathrm{MVR}_{\Pi+\Delta\Pi}(S)=1$ | Stabilized admissible regime | Second-order forgery sensitivity, failure of perturbation invariance, collapse into snapshot sufficiency, emergence of disqualifiers under stability window |

The table is normative. It binds the threshold semantics and makes explicit that each threshold has its own admissibility target, evidence obligations, and failure modes. Subsequent chapters SHALL treat these thresholds as operators within the certification and instrumentation logic, not as rhetorical labels.
