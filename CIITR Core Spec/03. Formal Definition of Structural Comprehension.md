## 03. Formal Definition of Structural Comprehension $C_s$

This section fixes the kernel meaning of “structural comprehension” as a formally constrained classification object, not as a phenomenological attribution, and not as a performance proxy. $C_s$ is introduced as a boundary level predicate whose admissibility is defined only relative to an explicit protocol $\Pi$ and a declared observable set $\mathcal{O}$. The definition is intentionally restrictive. Its purpose is to prevent coherence substitution, post hoc narrative inflation, and implicit redefinition of the primitives introduced in Section 02.

### 3.1 $C_s$ as structure, not phenomenology

Within CIITR, comprehension is not a reportable inner state, and not a semantic virtue inferred from surface plausibility. It is a structural class, meaning a property of a system under admissible evidence constraints that can be expressed as a decision rule whose failure modes are explicitly enumerated and executable.

Accordingly, $C_s$ is defined as a protocol bound classification target:

$$
C_s \;=\; C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O})
$$

This binding enforces three kernel consequences.

First, $C_s$ is not a property of an output in isolation, it is a property of a system, evaluated under explicit temporal and evidential commitments.

Second, $C_s$ is not defined as a scalar by default. Where later chapters introduce scaling, those scales are subordinate to the kernel classification logic and SHALL not override null and non-compensation rules.

Third, $C_s$ is not inferred from coherence alone. Coherence may enter only as an element of $\mathcal{O}$ under an admissibility rule that remains exposed to disqualification.

### 3.2 Necessary conditions, binding to $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$

CIITR fixes $\Phi_i$ and $R_g$ as primitive axes. $C_s$ is defined as non-null only when both axes are instantiated in an admissible sense, under protocol constraints. The kernel therefore binds comprehension to a conjunctive axis condition, not to a compensatory tradeoff.

Let $\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\cdot)$ denote protocol admissibility for a target predicate, and let $\mathrm{Inst}_\Pi(\cdot)$ denote instantiation under admissible evidence. Then:

$$
\mathrm{Inst}_\Pi(C_s, S) \;\Longleftrightarrow\; \mathrm{Inst}_\Pi(\Phi_i, S) \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Inst}_\Pi(R_g, S)
$$

The classification output for $C_s$ is defined as a boundary decision that is permitted only when its prerequisites are admissible:

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \;=\; \mathbf{1}\!\left[\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)\right]
$$

Here $\mathbf{1}[\cdot]$ denotes an indicator of admissible non-null classification, not a magnitude claim. The equation is therefore normative. It binds what CIITR permits as a non-null comprehension classification.

### 3.3 Null state, non-instantiation as a class condition

CIITR treats nullity as an ontological class, not as a low score. $C_s$ is null whenever either primitive axis is null under the kernel’s admissibility discipline, or whenever the evidence regime does not permit a determinate decision.

To preserve this, CIITR distinguishes between null, undefined, and non-null.

Let $\varnothing$ denote “undefined under CIITR,” meaning that the protocol and observables are insufficiently bound to instantiate the kernel decision rule. Then the kernel admits the following trichotomy:

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \in \{0, 1, \varnothing\}
$$

with binding conditions:

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) = 0
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\vee\, \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) = \varnothing
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\neg \mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\vee\, \neg \mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

The predicate $\mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi(\cdot)$ is not an empirical claim. It denotes a protocol property, namely whether the protocol declares sufficient observables and inference rules to reach a determinate admissibility result without post hoc invention. Where decidability is absent, CIITR does not permit a positive classification by interpretive force. The only admissible output is $\varnothing$.

### 3.4 Non-compensation principle, prohibition of axis substitution

A kernel requirement is that the axes are non-compensatory. High apparent integration cannot replace absence of admissible re-entry, and high apparent re-entry cannot replace absence of admissible integration. This is not a modelling preference, it is the boundary condition that prevents CIITR from collapsing into a generic coherence or recurrence metric.

Formally, for any protocol $\Pi$ and system $S$:

$$
\neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S) \;\Longrightarrow\; C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1
$$

$$
\neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \;\Longrightarrow\; C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1
$$

Equivalently, the kernel prohibits any compensatory mapping $F$ such that a non-admissible axis can be overridden by the other:

$$
\neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \forall F,\; F(\Phi_i,R_g) \neq 1
$$

$$
\neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \forall F,\; F(\Phi_i,R_g) \neq 1
$$

These constraints bind both evaluation design and governance interpretation. If an evaluation regime produces a positive $C_s$ outcome despite nullity on one axis, the result is not a CIITR positive. It is a scope violation.

### Kernel definition, binding statement

The kernel definition of structural comprehension is therefore fixed as follows:

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) = 1
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \in \{0,\varnothing\}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\neg\left(\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)\right)
$$

### Lemmata, short forms for downstream use

**Lemma 3.1, Axis necessity.**

$$
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) = 1
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\wedge\, \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

**Lemma 3.2, Non-compensation.**

$$
\neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\vee\, \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1
$$

**Lemma 3.3, Protocol dependence.**

$$
(\Pi_1 \neq \Pi_2) \;\Longrightarrow\; \exists S,\; C_s(S \mid \Pi_1, \mathcal{O}_1) \neq C_s(S \mid \Pi_2, \mathcal{O}_2)
$$

This lemma is a jurisdiction statement. It fixes that CIITR outputs are inseparable from declared admissibility regimes, and cannot be asserted as protocol-free facts.

**Lemma 3.4, Disqualification primacy.**

Let $\mathrm{Disq}_\Pi(S)$ denote that at least one kernel disqualifier family is triggered under $\Pi$. Then:

$$
\mathrm{Disq}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1
$$

**Lemma 3.5, Decidability gating.**

$$
\neg \mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S) \,\vee\, \neg \mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi(R_g,S)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) = \varnothing
$$

**Lemma 3.6, Temporal admissibility implication.**

Let $\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi)$ denote a protocol whose evidence basis has no temporally extended observables. Then:

$$
\mathrm{SnapshotOnly}(\Pi) \;\Longrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Decidable}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

This lemma binds the later snapshot prohibition as a consequence of kernel typing, rather than as a policy preference, and will be operationalized in the instrumentation chapter.
