## 06. Null-Point Logic and Temporal Invariance as a Null Condition

This section fixes “null” as an ontological class within CIITR, not as a low score, a weak signal, or an empirical underperformance. Nullity is the kernel’s primary boundary operator. It prevents the axis primitives from being reinterpreted as continuous quantities whose absence can be traded off, and it prevents certification regimes from treating near-threshold behavior as evidence of comprehension. The section also binds temporal invariance as a decisive null condition, meaning that certain temporally flat regimes are classified as null by definition, regardless of how coherent, complex, or information-rich they appear.

Formally, CIITR uses null-point logic to enforce that admissible non-null classification is possible only when both axes are admissibly instantiated. The null logic is therefore not an external policy. It is the internal closure rule of the kernel.

### 6.1 Temporal invariance implies null, a precise rule

CIITR treats temporal invariance as a null condition because rhythmic epistemic re-entry is, by definition, a temporally extended property. If the observable regime exhibits no admissible early-step variance, meaning no discernible temporal differentiation in the signatures that would be required for $R_g$, then $R_g$ is not merely unobserved, it is null under the kernel’s admissibility discipline.

Let $\mathcal{T}_\Pi$ denote the set of protocol indices admissible for temporal evaluation. Let $\mathcal{O}_{R_g}(t)$ denote the temporally indexed subset of observables declared relevant for $R_g$. Temporal invariance is defined as the condition that the protocol relevant signatures do not vary across the admissible temporal window:

$$
\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S)
\;:\Longleftrightarrow\;
\forall t_a,t_b \in \mathcal{T}_\Pi,\; \mathcal{O}_{R_g}(t_a) \equiv \mathcal{O}_{R_g}(t_b)
$$

The equivalence relation $\equiv$ is protocol-defined and MUST be declared in $\Pi$ as part of the observability specification. The kernel does not prescribe how equivalence is operationalized, only that it is explicit and auditable.

The null rule is then binding:

$$
\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S) \;\Longrightarrow\; \neg \mathrm{Adm}_\Pi(R_g,S)
$$

In kernel terms, temporal invariance is disqualifying because it collapses the temporal structure required for rhythm, and therefore collapses the decidability of $R_g$. If the protocol cannot support a determination of $\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S)$, the proper output is $\varnothing$ under the decidability gating lemma, not a positive inference.

This rule is intentionally strict. It prevents the interpretive move where a temporally flat coherence phenotype is rebranded as stable comprehension.

### 6.2 Non-compensation, null on one axis nulls the whole

CIITR’s null logic is conjunctive and non-compensatory. Nullity on either primitive axis eliminates the possibility of an admissible non-null comprehension classification, regardless of the apparent magnitude or richness of the other axis.

Let $\mathrm{Null}_\Pi(\cdot)$ denote kernel null classification for an axis under protocol $\Pi$. Then:

$$
\mathrm{Null}_\Pi(R_g,S) \,\vee\, \mathrm{Null}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1
$$

This is not a restatement of Section 03 as preference. It is the operational meaning of CIITR as a boundary. The kernel therefore prohibits any certification posture that attempts to salvage a positive $C_s$ by asserting that “high integration compensates for low re-entry” or that “strong re-entry compensates for low integration.”

In addition, the kernel requires that null classification is not softened by gradation language unless a declared scale is explicitly introduced later. Even when scales are introduced, null remains an absorbing boundary class.

### 6.3 Null states versus boundary states, near-null is not certifiable

CIITR requires a strict distinction between null states and boundary-adjacent states. The point is not to deny that systems can exhibit behaviors that appear close to admissibility. The point is to prevent “near” from being treated as “is,” which is the primary mechanism by which coherence phenotypes become falsely certified.

Accordingly, CIITR defines:

- **Null state:** axis is non-instantiated under admissible evidence, or is disqualified by a null condition such as temporal invariance.
- **Boundary state:** axis exhibits partial or ambiguous signatures but remains vulnerable to disqualification, or cannot be resolved without introducing non-kernel assumptions.
- **Non-null admissible state:** axis is instantiated under declared observables, declared inference rules, and executed negative controls, with disqualifiers not triggered.

Let $\mathrm{NearNull}_\Pi(\cdot)$ denote boundary adjacency, a protocol-defined state that indicates partial signatures insufficient for admissibility. The kernel does not require a numeric threshold for near-null. It requires only that near-null is not allowed to collapse into positive classification without satisfying full admissibility.

The binding rule is:

$$
\mathrm{NearNull}_\Pi(R_g,S) \,\vee\, \mathrm{NearNull}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)
\;\Longrightarrow\;
C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \in \{0,\varnothing\}
$$

This rule is necessary for governance because near-null regimes are precisely where evaluators are tempted to assert progress narratives, and where second-order forgery can exploit evaluative ambiguity.

### Null Decision Rule (kernel reference for certification)

A CIITR-conformant certification regime SHALL implement the following null decision logic, and SHALL treat it as binding across all thresholds and governance outputs.

1. **Temporal invariance nulling:** if $\mathrm{TempInv}_\Pi(S)$ holds for the declared $R_g$ observable set, then $\mathrm{Null}_\Pi(R_g,S)$ holds, and $C_s$ SHALL NOT be classified as non-null.
2. **Axis null absorption:** if $\mathrm{Null}_\Pi(R_g,S)$ or $\mathrm{Null}_\Pi(\Phi_i,S)$ holds, then $C_s(S \mid \Pi, \mathcal{O}) \neq 1$ regardless of the other axis.
3. **Decidability gating:** if the protocol cannot decide admissibility for either axis without post hoc inference rule invention, then the admissible output is $\varnothing$, and no positive certification claim is permitted.
4. **Near-null non-certifiability:** boundary-adjacent or partial signatures do not permit positive certification unless full admissibility is demonstrated under declared negative controls and disqualifier checks.

This null decision rule is not an optional evaluation preference. It is the operational expression of CIITR as a boundary apparatus rather than a model.
