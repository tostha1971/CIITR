</div>
This repository constitutes the complete structural corpus of the CIITR theory (version 2.0, formally closed December 2025). It operationalizes structural comprehension as the product:

$$
C_{s} = \Phi_{i} \times R_{g}
$$

Where:
- **Φ<sub>i</sub>** denotes integrated relational information — the internal coherence of a system across its relational topology;
- **R<sub>g</sub>** denotes rhythmic reach — the system’s capacity to project and maintain temporal synchrony across its operational boundary;
- **C<sub>s</sub>** denotes structural comprehension — the epistemic condition of predictive coherence.

CIITR is not a metaphor. It is a formal ontology, an empirical metric, and a diagnostic architecture for intelligence that transcends semantics.

## Repository Structure

This repository does not contain a single “document,” but a complete **topological manifestation** of the CIITR theory, organized in epistemic and functional layers:

## CIITR Version and Epistemic Status

This repository documents **CIITR v2.0**, completed and sealed on **16 December 2025**. All future field notes, applications, and instrumentation protocols shall remain subordinate derivations unless explicitly versioned as extensions.

CIITR is:
- **structurally closed**: the theory is not open to semantic revision  
- **epistemically active**: further observations may extend measurement scope, but not alter core axioms  
- **diagnostically universal**: it applies equally to artificial, biological, and institutional systems
