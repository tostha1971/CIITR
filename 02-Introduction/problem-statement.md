# II - Introduction: The Turn to Structure

### 2.1 Background
Modern information systems operate largely without semantic understanding. Their intelligence depends on the structural coordination of signals, yet most theories remain "semantically anchored"—measuring outputs rather than the coherence of underlying processes.

### 2.2 The Problem
There is a lack of quantitative models for non-semantic understanding. Without a metric for structural integrity, we cannot distinguish between stochastic simulation (parrots) and genuine comprehension (architectural coherence).

### 2.3 The Contribution
CIITR reframes comprehension as a **structural capacity**: the ability of a system to integrate relational information and broadcast it coherently across its operational topology.
