# I - Abstract: The CIITR Vision

CIITR (Cognitive Integration and Information Transfer Relation) establishes a formal metric for **structural comprehension**. 

### The Core Shift
We move from measuring intelligence as *fluency* to measuring it as *architecture*. By integrating principles from Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT), CIITR provides a quantitative bridge between relational integration ($\Phi_i$) and rhythmic reach ($R^g$).

### Theoretical Closure
This corpus constitutes a closed theoretical framework. It serves as the formal foundation for derivative architectures such as METAINT, Vardespeil, and R.E.S.
