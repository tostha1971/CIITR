# Theoretical Closure

**Definition:**
The formal state of the CIITR framework as a finalized, non-extensible core ontology.

**Implications:**
* **Fixed Axioms:** The fundamental rules of CIITR are no longer subject to modification.
* **Derivative Architectures:** Frameworks like METAINT are *applications* or *derivatives* of the closed CIITR corpus, but they do not alter the core ontogenetic rules.
* **Diagnostic Stability:** Closure ensures that the diagnostic instrument remains calibrated over time.
