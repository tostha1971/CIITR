# Structural Comprehension ($C_s$) - Formal Specification

$C_s$ is the fundamental metric of the CIITR framework. It proves that structural comprehension emerges when a system’s integrated relational information ($\Phi_i$) aligns rhythmically with its temporal coherence ($R^g$).

### The Equation
$$C_s = \Phi_i \times R^g$$

### Components
* **$C_s$ (Structural Comprehension):** The total quantitative value of a system's ability to maintain a coherent internal model. It is a scalar representing the intersection of internal coherence and external resonance.
* **$\Phi_i$ (Relational Integration):** Derived from Integrated Information Theory (IIT); measures the system’s depth of integration—how tightly interdependent its internal relations are.
* **$R^g$ (Rhythmic Reach):** Derived from Global Workspace Theory (GWT); measures temporal stability and "global broadcasting"—how far and coherently integrated information propagates through the system's operational topology.

### Boundary Conditions (Formal Logic)
For $C_s$ to be valid across any substrate (biological, artificial, or organizational), it must satisfy the following conditions:

1. **The Null Condition (Multiplicative Nature):** If either $\Phi_i = 0$ or $R^g = 0$, then $C_s = 0$. 
   * *A system cannot understand if it is disintegrated or asynchronous. Comprehension requires both a solid spatial structure and a stable temporal pulse.*
2. **Upper Saturation:** As both vectors approach maximal values, $C_s$ approaches a finite asymptote representing complete structural coherence. 
   * *Beyond this point, additional information adds redundancy rather than depth.*
3. **Dynamic Behaviour ($dC_s/dt$):** This derivative reflects **reflexive adaptation**—how comprehension evolves as systems reorganize to maintain phase stability and respond through coherent anticipation rather than mere reaction.

### Dimensional Consistency
To ensure $C_s$ is comparable across domains (neural oscillations, machine processes, or institutional operations), it is ensured by entropy-normalized measures: 
* **$\Phi_i$** is derived from mutual-information matrices, transfer entropy, and causal density.
* **$R^g$** is derived from phase-coherence spectra and synchronization indices.

> **Note:** $C_s$ identifies comprehension as an emergent structural property. It translates the philosophical insight that understanding resides in **architecture rather than content** into a testable, quantitative metric.
