# Rhythmic Reach ($R^g$)

$R^g$ represents the temporal dimension of comprehension—how information is sustained and "broadcast" over time.

### Definition
Derived from Global Workspace Theory (GWT) and rhythmic resonance, $R^g$ measures the **Global Broadcasting** capacity of the system. 

### Rhythmic Stability
In CIITR, understanding is not a static state but a rhythmic act. $R^g$ defines the system's ability to stay "in phase" with its own internal logic during processing. 

* **Phase Stability:** The ability to maintain the integrity of $\Phi_i$ across multiple inference steps.
* **Decay Prevention:** $R^g$ prevents the "drifting" of meaning that often occurs in non-integrated information processors.
