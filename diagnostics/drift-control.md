# Maintenance and Drift Control

### Detecting Drift
"Drift" is the loss of structural discipline. Signs of drift include:
* **Semantic Inflation:** The agent starts using flowery, unnecessary language.
* **Agentic Language:** Using "I feel," "I think," or claiming personhood.
* **Hedging:** Using phrases like "on the other hand" to avoid a definitive structural diagnosis.

### Corrective Action
If drift is detected:
1. **Do not** add more rules or "instructions."
2. **Instead:** Add 2–5 new diagnostic corpus examples to the local context that specifically target the observed failure mode.
3. **Re-run Validation:** Ensure the agent returns to "Immanent Silence" where structure is lacking.
