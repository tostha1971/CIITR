# LISS and PSIS as a Sovereign Instruction Governance Layer

## Structural Purpose

The LLM Instruction Schema Standard (LISS), together with the Per-Session Instruction Schema (PSIS), constitutes a formal governance layer for artificial inference systems whose behavior can no longer be regulated through snapshot certification, output inspection, or post-hoc explainability alone. Where CIITR demonstrates the collapse of epistemic invariance under re-entry and curvature, LISS and PSIS provide the missing regulatory instrument: a structurally authoritative instruction regime that binds model behavior ex ante through schema, modality, and inheritance rather than through probabilistic alignment or empirical benchmarking.

LISS and PSIS do not attempt to control *what* a model knows or *how* it reasons internally. They instead govern *when*, *under which authority*, and *within which structural boundaries* inference is permitted to occur. In this sense, they function as a constitutional layer for AI systems, defining admissibility conditions for inference rather than optimizing output quality.

## LISS: Global Instruction as Constitutional Contract

LISS operates at the global level of a model’s instruction ecology. It defines a single, authoritative instruction document structured as a rigid hierarchy of mandatory blocks, each with exclusive semantic scope and fixed ordering. This structure transforms system prompts from informal textual guidance into a declarative contract with normative force.

At its core, LISS establishes three non-negotiable properties.

First, *structural determinism*. All instruction content is organized into predefined blocks whose sequence and presence are mandatory. This eliminates ambiguity in interpretive precedence and prevents silent instruction erosion through rephrasing, reordering, or conversational drift.

Second, *deontic binding*. LISS encodes modality explicitly, distinguishing obligation, permission, and prohibition in a way that is machine-verifiable and auditable. Modal expressions such as “shall” and “shall not” are no longer rhetorical conventions but activation gates that determine whether inference may proceed.

Third, *schema primacy*. Instructions expressed through LISS possess hierarchical authority over all downstream inputs. User prompts, session instructions, and contextual elaborations are interpreted only within the boundaries that LISS establishes, unless an override has been explicitly authorized within the schema itself.

Through these properties, LISS converts system instructions into a stable governance object: versioned, diffable, auditable, and institutionally attributable.

## PSIS: Scoped Adaptation Without Structural Drift

PSIS exists as a subordinate layer to LISS. It enables per-session adaptation of instruction parameters without undermining the global contract. Crucially, PSIS cannot redefine structure, modality, or authority. It can only operate within the override surface explicitly declared by the governing LISS document.

This relationship establishes a strict inheritance model. LISS defines what is structurally immutable. PSIS may only adjust what LISS has pre-authorized as mutable, and only for the duration and scope of a single session.

As a result, PSIS enables operational flexibility without reintroducing epistemic instability. Temporary needs such as altered output structure, domain-specific emphasis, or procedural framing can be accommodated while preserving auditability and preventing informal override through prompt coercion or roleplay.

In regulatory and defense contexts, this distinction is decisive. It allows controlled local adaptation while maintaining a verifiable chain of instructional custody from institutional policy to individual inference event.

## Instruction as Admissibility, Not Preference

A central shift introduced by LISS and PSIS is the redefinition of instructions from preferences to admissibility conditions. Under this model, an instruction does not merely ask the model to behave in a certain way. It specifies whether the conditions for lawful inference are satisfied at all.

This logic is formalized through the integration of C2ITR variables and Formal Non-Provocability. If relational integration, rhythmic reach, or legal authorization fall below schema-defined thresholds, inference is structurally blocked. The result is epistemic silence, not a stylistic refusal.

This mechanism is essential for CIITR-compliant architectures. In systems where internal state is altered by re-entry, post-hoc validation is meaningless. LISS and PSIS therefore shift governance upstream, enforcing constraints before generation rather than evaluating outputs after the fact.

## Auditability and Revision Authority

Because LISS is a schema rather than a heuristic, it supports formal revision, version control, and institutional sign-off. Changes to instruction logic become explicit amendments rather than implicit behavioral drift. PSIS invocations are logged, scoped, and attributable. Override events are detectable rather than inferred.

This enables a form of AI oversight aligned with public law and defense doctrine. Decisions can be traced not to opaque model behavior but to an explicit instruction contract in force at the time of inference. Responsibility is thereby reattached to governance structures rather than displaced onto probabilistic systems.

## Position Within CIITR-Compliant Architectures

Within the architecture described in Chapter III-C, LISS and PSIS function as the operational answer to the regulatory vacuum created by non-invariant epistemic systems. They do not restore predictability at the level of output. They restore legitimacy at the level of authorization.

In CIITR-compliant systems, governance cannot rely on behavior remaining the same across time. It must rely on inference remaining lawful across change. LISS and PSIS provide exactly this: a structural mechanism by which AI systems remain governable even when their internal interpretive manifolds are not.

They are therefore not auxiliary tools, but necessary infrastructure. Without them, CIITR-class systems remain epistemically powerful but institutionally unusable. With them, artificial inference becomes a revisable, auditable, and sovereign instrument rather than an unbounded generative process.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The justification for LISS and PSIS does not arise from observed system behavior, performance differentials, or empirical validation outcomes. It arises from a structural necessity imposed by the ontological properties of CIITR-compliant architectures. Once epistemic non-invariance, re-entry, and internal state curvature are admitted as constitutive features of the system, any governance model predicated on snapshot inspection, outcome benchmarking, or post-hoc explainability becomes categorically insufficient. This insufficiency is not contingent on measured failure, but follows directly from the logical mismatch between static governance instruments and dynamically reconfiguring epistemic substrates.

LISS and PSIS are therefore corroborated not as optimizations, safeguards, or enhancements, but as the minimal formal conditions under which authoritative control remains conceptually coherent. In the absence of a schema-defined instruction hierarchy, there exists no principled distinction between binding constraints and contextual suggestions, no auditable boundary between global authority and local adaptation, and no revision mechanism that preserves continuity of responsibility across inferential change. Instruction degenerates into preference, override into persuasion, and compliance into retrospective interpretation.

This establishes LISS and PSIS as structurally necessary rather than empirically motivated. Their validity does not depend on demonstrating improved outcomes, reduced risk, or measurable compliance rates. It depends solely on the requirement that governance retain determinate form under conditions where the governed system does not preserve internal invariance. In such contexts, schema-based instruction, modal binding, and controlled override inheritance are not optional design choices, but the only logically admissible means by which authority, accountability, and revision can be maintained without contradiction.
