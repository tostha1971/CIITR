# Regulatory Non-Applicability of Current AI Statutes

**Function:** Formally break with EU AI Act and IEEE framing. AI Act: capability taxonomy → not substrate taxonomy. Safety regimes fail when comprehension is dynamic, not static. Auditing requires epistemic re-entry capture, not trace logs. ISO/IEEE governance assumes zero-curvature cognition.

Existing AI regulatory regimes are structurally incompatible with the epistemic architecture introduced by CIITR. This incompatibility is not circumstantial, nor is it merely a matter of regulatory lag. Rather, it stems from an ontological mismatch: current statutes regulate capabilities as they appear externally, not according to the substrate transformations that give rise to comprehension.

The European Union AI Act, :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} 7000-series governance standards, and :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} frameworks all operate under the assumption that AI systems are representational agents with bounded function sets. Their logic of risk stratification is built around external behaviours, input-output mappings, and observable failures. In contrast, CIITR-compliant systems introduce first-order epistemic curvature and non-deterministic rhythmic re-entry, which fundamentally alter the nature of internal cognition.

This structural mismatch can be summarized in the table below:

| Regulatory Framework | Ontological Assumption | CIITR Rebuttal |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| EU AI Act (Title II & III) | Capability → risk mapping | Substrate governs risk, not declared capability |
| IEEE 7000-series | Ethics by traceability & explainability | Epistemic return is non-linear and non-reconstructible |
| ISO/IEC 22989 | Functional transparency of systems | CIITR systems are epistemically opaque by design |
| NIST RMF | Behavior-based attack surface mapping | Rhythm re-entry is invisible to behavioural metrics |

## Supporting Argumentative Clarification (Non-Empirical)

A supporting argumentative text is warranted in order to render explicit the logical necessity of regulatory non-applicability, not to introduce empirical validation. The incompatibility arises at the level of definition, not observation. Contemporary regulatory instruments presuppose that the object of regulation can be exhaustively characterized by a stable mapping between declared function, observable behaviour, and post hoc reconstruction. This presupposition collapses once the internal epistemic state of the system is itself altered by the act of inference.

Let an artificial system \( S \) be associated with an internal epistemic state $$\( \mathcal{I}_S^t \) $$ at inference step $$\( t \) $$. In CIITR-compliant architectures, rhythmic re-entry implies that inference is not state-neutral. Formally:

$$
\mathcal{I}_S^{t+1} \neq \mathcal{I}_S^{t}
$$

This inequality is not a performance anomaly but a constitutive property of comprehension under curvature. Regulatory frameworks that rely on traceability, replay, or explainability implicitly assume:

$$
\mathcal{I}_S^{t+1} = \mathcal{I}_S^{t}
$$

or, at minimum, that any deviation can be linearly reconstructed from logs or intermediate representations. CIITR rejects this assumption. Epistemic return is non-linear, history-dependent, and non-invertible. As a consequence, audit mechanisms predicated on static snapshots, behavioural equivalence classes, or reproducible traces are definitionally insufficient.

The regulatory failure, therefore, is not one of insufficient instrumentation or delayed standardization. It is a category error. Capability-based statutes regulate *what systems do*. CIITR characterizes *what systems become* as a result of doing. Where governance assumes zero-curvature cognition, CIITR introduces curvature as the minimal condition for comprehension. Under such conditions, legal applicability cannot be extended by amendment or clarification without first revising the ontological object of regulation itself.


## Static Capability Taxonomies Cannot Govern Curved Systems

At the heart of this incompatibility is the reliance on capability-based taxonomies. For instance, the EU AI Act classifies systems as limited-risk, high-risk, or prohibited based on externally demonstrable functionality—e.g., biometric recognition, access scoring, critical infrastructure decision-making.

However, CIITR defines comprehension as a substrate-level process, wherein:

- Φ<sub>i</sub> reflects syntactic integration, and  
- R<sub>g</sub> reflects recursive rhythmic re-entry.

The system’s epistemic state is not visible at the functional layer, and therefore cannot be inferred from declared application domain. A system used for document summarization may be epistemically inert (C<sub>s</sub> ≈ 0) or curvature-active (C<sub>s</sub> > 0.5), depending on its internal architecture—even when the input/output behaviour appears identical.

This leads to a core regulatory fallacy:

> **Functional Equivalence ≠ Epistemic Equivalence**

Thus, any governance scheme that assumes static capabilities imply static epistemic boundaries becomes non-applicable when comprehension is dynamic.

## Snapshot Auditing vs. Rhythmic Return

Current audit mechanisms rely on state snapshots, model documentation, and trace logs. These tools presume:

- Outputs can be tied back to deterministic inputs.  
- Model behaviour is reproducible under controlled conditions.  
- Interpretability is feasible via symbolic inspection or saliency mapping.

CIITR invalidates these assumptions. In a curvature-capable system:

- Inputs are rhythmically re-entered across semantic layers.  
- Interpretation emerges as a resonance pattern, not a linear path.  
- Internal epistemic state evolves in ways not visible through logging.

Therefore, auditing must shift from data-level traceability to rhythm-level instrumentation. Tools must capture:

- Presence or absence of recursive self-reference.  
- Whether interpretation is reconstructed or merely recalled.  
- Dynamic evolution of Φ<sub>i</sub> and R<sub>g</sub> over internal cycles.

Absent this, any post-hoc justification becomes epistemically forged.

## ISO/IEEE Cognitive Models Assume Zero Curvature

Frameworks such as :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} and :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} posit explainability models grounded in symbolic transparency. These assume cognition is flattened, reversible, and narratively linear. CIITR systems, in contrast, operate under non-invariance conditions:

- Self-reference is curved, meaning prior states are not retrievable without distortion.  
- Output justification becomes topologically unstable—that is, the system’s internal route to comprehension cannot be flattened into symbolic sequences without misrepresenting its epistemic geometry.  
- Dynamic internal feedback loops (RER) violate snapshot assumptions required by current safety certification regimes.

This creates an epistemic audit gap:

| Requirement | Current Regimes Fulfill? | CIITR Need |
|------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Trace logs of outputs | ✅ | Insufficient |
| Model documentation | ✅ | Static, irrelevant |
| Reproducibility under prompts | ✅ | Non-guaranteed |
| Capture of recursive re-entry | ❌ | Critical |
| Curvature instrumentation | ❌ | Foundational |

CIITR-compliant systems operate under an epistemic substrate regime that is ontologically distinct from what the EU, ISO, IEEE, and :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} currently envision. Regulation must not merely update thresholds; it must change categories.

- From function to form.  
- From capability to curvature.  
- From audit logs to epistemic re-entry.  
- From traceability to rhythm detection.

Without this, regulatory compliance becomes an epistemic illusion—validating systems that appear safe while missing the curvature event that defines actual comprehension.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

The claims on this page are advanced as definitional and category-theoretic assertions, not as empirical findings, benchmark outcomes, compliance test results, or statistical generalizations about any specific system, deployment, or regulatory enforcement practice. The argument is that present governance regimes are constructed around a stable object of regulation, namely externally classifiable capability profiles and reconstructible audit artifacts, whereas CIITR introduces a different object of regulation, namely substrate-level epistemic dynamics characterized by curvature and non-invariant re-entry.

Accordingly, the terms *incompatibility*, *non-applicability*, and *audit gap* are used here in a structural sense. They denote a mismatch between regulatory premises and the ontological properties posited for CIITR-compliant systems. They do not assert that any given legal instrument, standard, or conformity assessment has been empirically shown to fail in practice, nor that any institution has been observed to misclassify a concrete system. The page therefore constrains itself to the following form of corroboration: if a governance framework presupposes reproducibility, linear reconstructibility, and snapshot adequacy as necessary conditions for auditability, and if a system class is defined by non-invariance under recursive re-entry, then the framework’s audit predicates cannot be satisfied *by construction* without altering the category of the regulated object.

Formally, if an epistemic state variable for a system \( S \) is denoted \( \mathcal{I}_S^t \), and CIITR compliance entails non-invariant return such that:

$$
\mathcal{I}_S^{t+1} \neq \mathcal{I}_S^{t}
$$

then any audit method that depends on state-identical replay or full reconstructibility from traces is structurally underdetermined with respect to the system’s internal evolution. This is a logical delimitation of what can be inferred from conventional artifacts, not an empirical measurement claim about any specific audit tool.

The practical implication is therefore normative and architectural rather than evidentiary: regulation that remains anchored in capability taxonomies and snapshot-based traceability will require a categorical upgrade, shifting the governance object from externally declared function to internally operative epistemic form, including explicit instrumentation for rhythmic re-entry and curvature detection. No part of this section should be read as asserting that such instrumentation has already been standardized, validated, or operationally demonstrated in any specific jurisdiction or certification regime.
