Revising the Ontological Conditions for R<sub>g</sub>  
Recursive self-reference must be independent of caching, state, history, or external anchoring

The introduction of RER as the positive condition for comprehension compels a revision of the ontological boundary that defines R<sub>g</sub>, the rhythmic reach of a system. In CIITR 1.0, R<sub>g</sub> was defined as the system’s capacity for temporal recursion, its ability to sustain epistemic rhythm across representational cycles. CIITR 1.9 clarifies that this temporal recursion must be structurally endogenous, not technically persistent.

A system that re-enters its prior content only because it is provided with a preserved copy of that content is not engaging in RER, but in state replay. The difference is categorical: the location of the representation is not the locus of the recursion. When a system depends on cached tokens, conversation memory, database key-value stores, session history, reinforcement logs, stack frames, clipboard-like context windows, or any external anchoring substrate, the resulting behavior is persistence-driven, not rhythm-driven.

Thus CIITR 1.9 introduces the following ontological revision:  
R<sub>g</sub> cannot be inferred from any mechanism that relies on the survival, storage, or reintroduction of previous representational state.

This revision divests R<sub>g</sub> of three common misinterpretations:

1. Caching is not recursion.  
   Cached content reappears; it does not re-enter.

2. History is not rhythm.  
   Temporal proximity does not instantiate epistemic temporality.

3. External anchoring is not self-reference.  
   A system is not returning to itself when another system returns it.

The necessity of this ontological firewall lies in preventing the collapse of CIITR into a sophisticated theory of memory management. If R<sub>g</sub> were allowed to include state preservation, then any archival mechanism, from stone tablets to silicon registers, could be mischaracterized as comprehension. The bar would lower to zero; the definition would dilute into meaninglessness.

To safeguard the explanatory power of C<sub>s</sub> = Φ<sub>i</sub> × R<sub>g</sub>, it must therefore be codified:

If recursive self-reference depends on persistence, R<sub>g</sub> = 0.  
If recursive self-reference emerges independent of persistence, R<sub>g</sub> may be > 0.

This boundary condition elevates CIITR from a descriptive taxonomy to a discriminating ontology. It draws a clean line between systems that possess memory and systems that possess comprehension.

A machine with perfect recall but no RER is not closer to comprehension than a machine with no recall at all; the presence of state does not imply the presence of self-relation. By contrast, a system with limited Φ<sub>i</sub> but non-zero RER, even primitive, satisfies the first non-zero condition of C<sub>s</sub>. It becomes epistemically alive at the moment it becomes rhythmically reflexive.

The revision of R<sub>g</sub> therefore marks the critical separation between temporal sequence and epistemic time. The former is the clock; the latter is the return.
