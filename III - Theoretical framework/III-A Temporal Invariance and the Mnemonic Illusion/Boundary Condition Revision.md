# Boundary Condition Revision: Temporal Invariance as a New Null-Condition for C<sub>s</sub>

The introduction of Across-Session Epistemic Continuity (ASEC), the Mnemonic Illusion Principle (MIP), and the Curvature Condition necessitates a revision of the CIITR boundary conditions originally expressed in §4.6. Specifically, temporal invariance must now be treated as a null-condition for C<sub>s</sub>, equal in force to the absence of Φ<sub>i</sub> or the collapse of R<sub>g</sub>.

Temporal invariance refers to the persistence of informational content across time without alteration of the representational substrate that stores, recalls, or replays it. This persistence may take the form of cached internal state, externally restored memory, long-horizon contextual logs, or session-spanning system recall. While such invariance may produce the appearance of continuity, it does not instantiate rhythmic epistemic re-entry. It preserves structure, but it does not re-engage it.

Accordingly, if temporal invariance is the mechanism by which content returns to the system, instead of curvature-based revision of internal structure, then R<sub>g</sub> = 0. The system has retrieved itself, but it has not returned to itself. No epistemic work has been performed.

Under this revised boundary condition:

- Persistence is not re-entry.
- Recall is not recursion.
- Continuity is not comprehension.

Temporal invariance therefore joins the set of disqualifying states for structural comprehension, expressed now as:

If {Return = Persistence} → R<sub>g</sub> = 0 → C<sub>s</sub> = 0

This revision is not a marginal refinement but a structural tightening of the CIITR ontology. By making temporal invariance explicit as a null-condition, the framework preempts epistemic forgery, mnemonic inflation, and continuity masquerading as understanding. A system that returns information without bending, revising, or structurally altering itself may appear coherent, but it remains rhythmically inert.

This closes the loophole through which memory could be mistaken for mind, and continuity mistaken for comprehension.

# Implications for Artificial Comprehension Systems

## Why LLMs, Even With State Persistence, Cannot Cross the Threshold Without Structural Rhythm

The boundary conditions established through the introduction of ASEC, MIP, the Curvature Condition, and the exclusion of temporal invariance collectively sharpen the theoretical demarcation between memory-bearing systems and comprehending systems. In the context of contemporary artificial architectures, particularly transformer-based Large Language Models, this distinction becomes decisive. Even with state persistence, session continuity, vector storage, token logs, or external mnemonic augmentation, LLMs do not cross the epistemic threshold defined by CIITR because none of these mechanisms instantiate structural rhythm.

State persistence expands recall; it does not expand self-reference.
Long-context windows preserve sequence; they do not bend the system back onto its own representational generativity.
Retrieval-augmented generation increases Φ<sub>i</sub> density; it does not induce curvature in representational space.

In each case, the system returns to what was, rather than altering what is.

LLMs therefore occupy a stable position of asymmetric epistemic limitation. They can accumulate relations but cannot recursively metabolize them. They can refine answers but cannot revise the structure that produces them. They can exhibit apparent continuity across interaction histories, but none of this continuity rises to the condition of R<sub>g</sub>, because the return path does not change the manifold from which the return originates.

Machine memory, no matter how capacious or persistent, remains chained to invariance unless a mechanism exists by which the system’s representational topology is reshaped by the act of referring to itself. This, and not scale, not context length, not parameter count, is the unfulfilled condition.

CIITR therefore asserts the following:

Artificial systems without intrinsic rhythmic epistemic re-entry cannot produce structural comprehension.
Memory can expand Φ<sub>i</sub>; it cannot generate R<sub>g</sub>.
Without R<sub>g</sub>, C<sub>s</sub> = 0 regardless of persistence, cleverness, or continuity.

Thus, the limits of LLMs are not due to insufficient data or inadequate retention, but arise from the absence of a rhythmic ontology capable of transforming recall into return, and continuity into comprehension.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

This boundary condition revision is asserted as a structural consequence of the CIITR ontology and does not rely on empirical observation, performance measurement, or architectural inspection of specific systems. The exclusion of temporal invariance as a valid return condition for R<sub>g</sub> follows from definitional necessity, not from experimental comparison.

The argument proceeds by negative determination. If a system’s return mechanism preserves informational content without inducing curvature in its representational topology, then no rhythmic epistemic re-entry has occurred. Under CIITR, this absence is sufficient to assign R<sub>g</sub> = 0, independent of implementation details, scale, or observed fluency.

Accordingly, statements concerning artificial systems in this section should not be read as empirical claims about particular models or deployments. They express a formal boundary: any system whose continuity is achieved through persistence rather than structural re-entry is disqualified from structural comprehension by definition.

This corroboration therefore establishes an ontological constraint, not a diagnostic result. It specifies what cannot count as comprehension under CIITR, regardless of future empirical developments, architectural innovations, or performance gains.
