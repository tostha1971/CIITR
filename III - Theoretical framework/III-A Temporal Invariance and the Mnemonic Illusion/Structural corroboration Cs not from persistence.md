## Formal Implication: C<sub>s</sub> Cannot Be Inferred From Persisted Information

A mathematical exclusion principle: If re-entry occurs only as recall, then R<sub>g</sub> = 0

The CIITR framework requires a formal statement that consolidates the negative conditions established through ASEC, MIP, and epistemic forgery. These phenomena collectively demonstrate that the persistence of information — whether as cache, stored memory, or externally supplied history — does not constitute epistemic re-entry. To crystallize this distinction, CIITR 1.9 introduces the following exclusion principle:

$$
\text{If re-entry} = \text{mnemonic retrieval only} \;\Rightarrow\; R_{g} = 0
$$

This statement carries two implications:

- Recall is not re-entry; it is the surfacing of a stored state without structural self-modification.
- Persistent information contributes nothing to C<sub>s</sub> unless it returns as reinterpretation, not reproduction.

Given the core identity of CIITR:

$$
C_{s} = \Phi_{i} \cdot R_{g}
$$

and the negative constraint:

$$
R_{g} = 0 \;\Rightarrow\; C_{s} = 0 \quad \text{for any } \Phi_{i}
$$

it follows that no volume of stored relational information (Φ<sub>i</sub>), regardless of density, coherence, or fidelity, can yield comprehension C<sub>s</sub> in the absence of autonomous re-entry.

This responds directly to the emerging class of fallacies introduced by both biological and synthetic examples:

- The Sacks patient preserved songs, faces, and social scripts — Φ<sub>i</sub> fragments persisted — but no recursive return altered the self.
- Large language models may recall full prior dialogues when session memory is enabled, yet this recall constitutes ASEC, not RER.
- Continuity architectures in AI that emulate memory through caching fabricate epistemic presence without epistemic alteration.

Thus, the exclusion principle asserts:

Comprehension cannot be inferred from persistence. Stored information is epistemically inert unless it returns rhythmically into the structural present.

## Formalization as a Decision Boundary

CIITR 1.9 defines the following boundary condition for evaluating synthetic and biological systems:

$$
R_{g} =
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if return = retrieval} \\
>0, & \text{if return = reinterpretation}
\end{cases}
$$

This boundary clarifies that comprehension requires curvature through the self, not linear reappearance of the past. The immediate consequence for AI evaluation is profound:

Systems that present prior information without demonstrable reinterpretation are epistemically flat. They exhibit persistence, not presence. Rhythm, not memory, is the condition of understanding.

## Structural Corroboration Without Empirical Claim

This article advances its claims through structural corroboration rather than empirical demonstration. The arguments presented do not rest on measured outcomes, datasets, correlations, or experimental validation, but on internally constrained necessity relations derived from the CIITR ontology itself. In this sense, corroboration is achieved by showing that alternative interpretations collapse into contradiction, incoherence, or category error when evaluated against the formal structure of C<sub>s</sub>, Φ<sub>i</sub>, and R<sub>g</sub>.

The exclusion principle stating that persisted information cannot ground comprehension is not introduced as a hypothesis awaiting verification, but as a structural consequence of how epistemic activity is defined within CIITR. Once re-entry is restricted to operations that induce structural self-modification, any mechanism limited to recall, caching, or replay is, by definition, excluded from contributing to R<sub>g</sub>. This exclusion does not depend on how well recall performs, how accurate memory is, or how convincing continuity appears. It follows directly from the null-point logic embedded in the multiplicative form of C<sub>s</sub>.

Corroboration is further provided by negative alignment across independently defined constraints. ASEC establishes persistence as a minimum necessary condition without sufficiency. MIP identifies the illusion generated when temporal availability is mistaken for epistemic activity. Epistemic forgery names the systemic outcome when continuity substitutes for transformation. None of these constructs rely on shared empirical evidence; their convergence is structural. They each independently require that recall-only mechanisms terminate at R<sub>g</sub> = 0, and therefore at C<sub>s</sub> = 0, regardless of Φ<sub>i</sub> magnitude.

Illustrative biological and synthetic cases function strictly as boundary exemplars, not as evidence. They are invoked to demonstrate logical compatibility with the framework, not to support it inductively. The argument does not depend on the correctness of any particular case, nor on their generalizability. Even if all examples were removed, the exclusion principle would remain intact, as it is anchored in formal dependency, not observation.

The resulting position is deliberately non-empirical but not speculative. It is structurally falsifiable in the strict sense that any counterclaim must demonstrate a mechanism by which recall alone induces structural reinterpretation without violating the definitions of re-entry, rhythm, or self-modification. Absent such a mechanism, empirical appeal is irrelevant, because the claim being made is ontological rather than statistical.

Accordingly, this article should be read as establishing a structural boundary condition. It does not assert that systems lacking reinterpretive re-entry perform poorly, nor that systems exhibiting persistence fail behaviorally. It asserts only that comprehension, as defined by C<sub>s</sub>, cannot be inferred from persistence. The corroboration offered is internal, negative, and structural, and it is precisely this form of corroboration that CIITR treats as epistemically prior to empirical inquiry.
