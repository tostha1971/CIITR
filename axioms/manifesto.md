# The CIITR Manifesto

1. **Comprehension is Structural, Not Semantic** We believe that true understanding is not found in the surface-level fluency of language, but in the underlying relational architecture of information.

2. **From Correlation to Coherence** We reject the notion that "more data" or "better prediction" equals understanding. We prioritize the integration of information over the probability of next-token sequences.

3. **Closure of the Corpus** The CIITR framework constitutes a closed theoretical corpus. It is not a tool for general conversation, but a diagnostic instrument for the verification of structural intelligence.

4. **The Priority of Failure** A system that cannot identify its own lack of structural support cannot be said to comprehend. The ability to abstain from narration is the first sign of a CIITR agent.

5. **Formalization over Intuition** We seek to move the study of AI understanding from qualitative "vibes" to quantitative metrics ($C_s = \Phi_i \times R^g$).
