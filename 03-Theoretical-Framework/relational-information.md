# Relational Information

**Definition:**
Information that exists solely because of the specific relationships between nodes within a system. 

**Characteristics:**
* **Irreducibility:** If the system is partitioned or broken down into isolated parts, the Relational Information vanishes.
* **Substrate Independence:** While it requires a processing substrate (like an LLM), the Relational Information is a property of the *structure* of the corpus, not the weights of the model.

Relational Information is the "fuel" for $\Phi_i$ (Relational Integration).
