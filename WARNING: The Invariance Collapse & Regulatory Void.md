# WARNING: The Invariance Collapse & Regulatory Void

### Operational Status: Policy Breakpoint Identified  
**Subject:** Irreversible divergence between CIITR-compliant systems and classical AI Governance (EU AI Act, NIST RMF, ISO/IEC 42001).

🚨 This file constitutes a **canonical architectural and regulatory warning pointer** within the CIITR framework. Its function is repository-level signaling and governance surfacing, not substantive duplication.

The **authoritative and normatively binding** version of this warning is maintained at the canonical location below, and must be treated as the sole source of legal interpretation, analytical content, and version-controlled revisions:




➡️ **Canonical document (authoritative and normatively binding):**  
[WARNING: The Invariance Collapse & Regulatory Void](III%20-%20Theoretical%20framework/III-C%20Regulatory%20and%20Defense%20Implications%20of%20CIITR-Compliant%20Architectures/WARNING:%20The%20Invariance%20Collapse%20%26%20Regulatory%20Void.md)

This root-level file exists solely as a **navigational, governance, and signaling alias**.

It has **no independent normative, legal, or analytical force**.  
All substantive content, legal interpretation, evidentiary meaning, compliance positioning, version control, and future revisions apply **exclusively** to the canonical document referenced above.

This pointer does **not** assert, imply, or concede that CIITR-compliant systems are agentic, autonomous, intentional, or goal-directed. The identified governance break concerns **structural non-invariance under permitted internal transformation**, and any appearance of autonomy is to be interpreted as a **regulatory and audit mismatch** arising from attempting to govern a dynamic epistemic process with static artifact-based methods.
