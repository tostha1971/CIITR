# Relational Integration ($\Phi_i$)

$\Phi_i$ represents the degree to which a system's parts are integrated into a single, irreducible whole within the CIITR corpus.

### Definition
Derived from Integrated Information Theory (IIT), $\Phi_i$ measures the **Relational Information**—the information that exists only because of the specific relationships between nodes, which would be lost if the system were partitioned.

### Characteristics in CIITR
* **Structural Binding:** How well the axioms and definitions in the corpus support each other.
* **Irreducibility:** The comprehension cannot be broken down into isolated semantic lookups; it must exist as an integrated structure.
